There was the Lawyer,\\r\\nwho knew international law as he knew his Greek alphabet, and hated a\\r\\ncourt room. There was the Violinist, who was known the world over in\\r\\nmusical sets,--everywhere, except in the concert room. There was the\\r\\nJournalist, who had travelled into almost as many queer places as\\r\\nRichard Burton, seen more wars, and followed more callings. There was\\r\\nthe Sculptor, the fame of whose greater father had almost paralyzed a\\r\\npair of good modeller\\'s hands. There was the Critic, whose friends\\r\\nbelieved that in him the world had lost a great romancer, but whom a\\r\\ncombination of hunger and laziness, and a proneness to think that\\r\\nnothing not genius was worth while, had condemned to be a mere\\r\\nbreadwinner, but a breadwinner who squeezed a lot out of life, and who\\r\\nfervently believed that in his next incarnation he would really be\\r\\n\"it.\" Then there was \"Me,\" and of the other two women--one was a\\r\\nTrained Nurse, and the other a Divorcee, and--well, none of us really\\r\\nknew just what she had become, but we knew that she was very rich, and\\r\\nvery handsome, and had a leaning toward some sort of new religion. As\\r\\nfor the Youngster--he was the son of an old chum of the Doctor--his\\r\\nward, in fact--and his hobby was flying.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur reunion, after so many years, was a rather pretty story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1913, the Doctor and the Divorcee, who had lost sight\\r\\nof one another for twenty years, met by chance in Paris. Her\\r\\nex-husband had been a college friend of the Doctor. They saw a great\\r\\ndeal of one another in the lazy way that people who really love\\r\\nFrance, and are done sightseeing, can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day it occurred to them to take a day\\'s trip into the country, as\\r\\nunattached people now and then can do. They might have gone out in a\\r\\ncar--but they chose the railroad, with a walk at the end--on the\\r\\nprinciple that no one can know and love a country who does not press\\r\\nits earth beneath his feet,--the Doctor would probably have said, \"lay\\r\\nhis head upon its bosom.\" By an accident--they missed a train--they\\r\\nfound themselves at sunset of a beautiful day in a small village, and\\r\\nwith no possible way of getting back to Paris that night unless they\\r\\nchose to walk fifteen miles to the nearest railway junction. After a\\r\\nlong day\\'s tramp that seemed too much of a good thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they looked about to find a shelter for the night. The village--it\\r\\nwas only a hamlet--had no hotel, no cafe, even. Finally an old peasant\\r\\nsaid that old Mother Servin--a widow--living a mile up the road--had a\\r\\nbig house, lived alone, and could take them in,--if she wanted to,--he\\r\\ncould not say that she would.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to them worth trying, so they started off in high spirits to\\r\\ntramp another mile, deciding that, if worse became worst--well--the\\r\\nnight was warm--they could sleep by the roadside under the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was near the hour when it should have been dark--but in France at\\r\\nthat season one can almost read out of doors until nine--when they\\r\\nfound the place. With some delay the gate in the stone wall was\\r\\nopened, and they were face to face with the old widow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a long argument, but the Doctor had a winning way, and at the\\r\\nend they were taken in,--more, they were fed in the big clean\\r\\nkitchen, and then each was sheltered in a huge room, with cement\\r\\nfloor, scrupulously clean, with the quaint old furniture and the queer\\r\\nappointments of a French farmhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, when the Doctor threw open the heavy wooden shutters\\r\\nto his window, he gave a whistle of delight to find himself looking\\r\\nout into what seemed to be a French Paradise--and better than that he\\r\\nhad never asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a wilderness. Way off in the distance he got glimpses of broken\\r\\nwalls with all kinds of green things creeping and climbing, and\\r\\nhanging on for life. Inside the walls there was a riot of\\r\\nflowers--hollyhocks and giroflees, dahlias and phlox, poppies and huge\\r\\ndaisies, and roses everywhere, even climbing old tree trunks, and\\r\\nsprawling all over the garden front of the rambling house. The edges\\r\\nof the paths had green borders that told of Corbeil d\\'Argent in\\r\\nMidwinter, and violets in early spring. He leaned out and looked along\\r\\nthe house. It was just a jumble of all sorts of buildings which had\\r\\nevidently been added at different times. It seemed to be on half a\\r\\ndozen elevations, and no two windows were of the same size, while\\r\\nhere and there an outside staircase led up into a loft.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce he had taken it in he dressed like a flash--he could not get out\\r\\ninto that garden quickly enough, to pray the Widow to serve coffee\\r\\nunder a huge tree in the centre of the garden, about the trunk of\\r\\nwhich a rude table had been built, and it was there that the Divorcee\\r\\nfound him when she came out, simply glowing with enthusiasm--the\\r\\nhouse, the garden, the Widow, the day--everything was perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were taking their coffee, poured from the earthen jug, in\\r\\nthe thick old Rouen cups, the Divorcee said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I\\'d love to own a place like this. No one would ever dream of\\r\\nbuilding such a house. It has taken centuries of accumulated needs to\\r\\nexpand it into being. If one tried to do the thing all at once it\\r\\nwould look too on-purpose. This place looks like a happy combination\\r\\nof circumstances which could not help itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, why not? It might be possible to have just this. Let\\'s ask the\\r\\nWidow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when they were sitting over their cigarettes, and the old woman\\r\\nwas clearing the table, the Doctor looked her over, and considered\\r\\nthe road of approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a rugged old woman, well on toward eighty, with a bronzed,\\r\\nweather-worn face, abundant coarse gray hair, a heavy shapeless\\r\\nfigure, but a firm bearing, in spite of her rounded back. As far as\\r\\nthey could see, they were alone on the place with her. The Doctor\\r\\ndecided to jump right into the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"I suppose you don\\'t want to sell this place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman eyed him a moment with her sharp dark eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, yes, _Monsieur_,\" she replied. \"I should like it very well, only\\r\\nit is not possible. No one would be willing to pay my price. Oh, no,\\r\\nno one. No, indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"how do you know that? What is the price?--Is\\r\\nit permitted to ask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman hesitated,--started to speak--changed her mind, and\\r\\nturned away, muttering. \"Oh, no, _Monsieur_,--it is not worth the\\r\\ntrouble--no one will ever pay my price.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor jumped up, laughing, ran after her, took her by the arm,\\r\\nand led her back to the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, come, come, Mother,\" he remarked, \"let us hear the price at any\\r\\nrate. I am so curious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Widow, \"it is like this. I would like to get for it\\r\\nwhat my brother paid for it, when he bought it at the death of my\\r\\nfather--it was to settle with the rest of the heirs--we were eight\\r\\nthen. They are all dead but me. But no, no one will ever pay that\\r\\nprice, so I may as well let it go to my niece. She is the last. She\\r\\ndoesn\\'t need it. She has land enough. The cultivator has a hard time\\r\\nthese days. It is as much as I can do to make the old place feed me\\r\\nand pay the taxes, and I am getting old. But no one will ever pay the\\r\\nprice, and what will my brother think of me when the _bon Dieu_ calls\\r\\nme, if I sell it for less than he paid? As for that, I don\\'t know what\\r\\nhe\\'ll say to me for selling it at all. But I am getting old to live\\r\\nhere alone--all alone. But no one will ever pay the price. So I may as\\r\\nwell die here, and then my brother can\\'t blame me. But it is lonely\\r\\nnow, and I am growing too old. Besides, I don\\'t suppose _you_ want to\\r\\nbuy it. What would a gentleman do with this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"I don\\'t really know what a _gentleman\\r\\nwould_ do with it,\" and he added, under his breath, in English, \"but I\\r\\nknow mighty well what this fellow _could_ do with it, if he could get\\r\\nit,\" and he lighted a fresh cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keen old eyes had watched his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t suppose _you_ want to buy it?\" she persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" responded the Doctor, \"how can a poor man like me say, if you\\r\\ndon\\'t care to name your price, and unless that price is within\\r\\nreason?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some minutes of hesitation the old woman drew a deep breath.\\r\\n\"Well,\" she said, with the determination of one who expected to be\\r\\nscoffed at, \"I won\\'t take a _sou_ less than my brother paid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on, Mother,\" said the Doctor, \"what _did_ your brother pay? No\\r\\nnonsense, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if you must know--it was FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS, and I\\r\\ncan\\'t and won\\'t sell it for less. There, now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor and his companion avoided one another\\'s eyes. After a\\r\\nwhile, he said in an undertone, in English: \"By Jove, I\\'m going to buy\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" remonstrated his companion, her eyes gazing down the garden\\r\\nvista to where the wistaria and clematis and flaming trumpet flower\\r\\nflaunted on the old wall. \"I am going to have it--I thought of it\\r\\nfirst. I want it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I,\" laughed the Doctor. \"Never wanted anything more in all my\\r\\nlife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For how long,\" she asked, \"would a rover like you want this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rover yourself! And you? Besides what difference does it make how\\r\\n_long_ I want it--since I want it _now_? I want to give a\\r\\nparty--haven\\'t given a party since--since Class Day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Divorcee sighed. Still gazing down the garden she said quietly:\\r\\n\"How well I remember--ninety-two!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there was another silence before she turned to him suddenly: \"See\\r\\nhere--all this is very irregular-so, that being the case--why\\r\\nshouldn\\'t we buy it together? We know each other. Neither of us will\\r\\never stay here long. One summer apiece will satisfy us, though it is\\r\\nlovely. Be a sport. We\\'ll draw lots as to who is to have the first\\r\\nparty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor waved the old woman away. Her keen eyes watched too\\r\\nsharply. Then, with their elbows on the table, they had a long and\\r\\nheated argument. Probably there were more things touched on than the\\r\\ngarden. Who knows? At the end of it the Divorcee walked away down that\\r\\ngarden vista, and the old woman was called and the Doctor took her at\\r\\nher word. And out of that arrangement emerged the scheme which\\r\\nresulted in our finding ourselves, a year later, within the old walls\\r\\nof that French garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course a year\\'s work had been done on the interior, and Doctor and\\r\\nDivorcee had scoured the department for old furniture. Water had been\\r\\nbrought a great distance, a garage had been built with servants\\'\\r\\nquarters over it--there were no servants in the house,--but the look\\r\\nof the place, we were assured, had not been changed, and both Doctor\\r\\nand Divorcee declared that they had had the year of their lives. Well,\\r\\nif they had, the place showed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as Fate would have it, the second night we sat down to dinner in\\r\\nthat garden, news had come of the assassination of Franz\\r\\nFerdinand-Charles-Louis Joseph-Marie d\\'Autriche-Este, whom the tragic\\r\\ndeath of Prince Rudolphe, almost exactly twenty-four years and six\\r\\nmonths earlier to a day, had made Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary--and\\r\\nthe tone of our gathering was changed. From that day the party\\r\\nthreatened to become a little Bedlam, and the garden a rostrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the earlier days it did not make so much difference. The talk was\\r\\ngood. We were a travelled group, and what with reminiscences of people\\r\\nand places, and the scandal of courts, it was far from being dull. But\\r\\nas the days went on, and the war clouds began to gather, the\\r\\novercharged air seemed to get on the nerves of the entire group, and\\r\\ninstead of the peaceful summer we had counted upon, every one of us\\r\\nseemed to live in his own particular kind of fever. Every one of us,\\r\\ndown to the Youngster, had fixed ideas, deep-set theories, and\\r\\nconvictions as different as our characters, our lives, our callings,\\r\\nand our faiths. We were all Cosmopolitan Americans, but ready to\\r\\nspread the Eagle, if necessary, and all of us, except the Violinist,\\r\\nof New England extraction, which means really of English blood, and\\r\\nthat _will_ show when the screws are put on. We had never thought of\\r\\nthe Violinist as not one of us, but he was really of Polish origin.\\r\\nHis great-grandfather had been a companion of Adam Czartoriski in the\\r\\nuprising of 1830, and had gone to the States when the amnesty was not\\r\\nextended to his chief after that rebellion, Poland\\'s last, had been\\r\\nstamped out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as I can remember it was the night of August 6th that the\\r\\nfirst serious dispute arose. England had declared war. All our male\\r\\nservants had left us except two American chauffeurs, and a couple of\\r\\nold outside men. Two of our four cars, and all our horses but one had\\r\\nbeen requisitioned. That did not upset us. We had taken on the wives\\r\\nof some of the men, among them Angele, the pretty wife of one of the\\r\\nFrench chauffeurs, and her two-months-old baby into the bargain. We\\r\\nstill had two cars, that, at a pinch, would carry the party, and we\\r\\nstill had one mount in case of necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question arose as to whether we should break up and make for the\\r\\nnearest port while we could, or \"stick it out.\" It had been finally\\r\\nagreed not to evacuate--_yet_. One does not often get such a chance to\\r\\nsee a country at war, and we were all ardent spectators, and all\\r\\nunattached. I imagine not one of us had at that time any idea of\\r\\nbeing useful--the stupendousness of it all had not dawned on any of\\r\\nus--unless it was the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after the decision of \"stick\" had been passed unanimously, the\\r\\nCritic, who was a bit of a sentimentalist, and if he were anything\\r\\nelse was a Norman Angel-lite, stuck his hands in his pockets, and\\r\\nremarked: \"After all, it is perfectly safe to stay, especially now\\r\\nthat England is coming in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think so?\" said the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure,\" smiled the Critic. \"The Germans will never cross the French\\r\\nfrontier this time. This is not 1870.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t they, and isn\\'t it?\" replied the Doctor sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They never can get by Verdun and Belfort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never said they could,\" remarked the Doctor, with a tone as near to a\\r\\nsneer as a good-natured host can allow himself. \"But they\\'ll invade\\r\\nfast enough. I know what I am talking about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean to tell me,\" said the Critic, \"that a nation like\\r\\nGermany--I\\'m talking now about the people, the country that has been\\r\\nthe hot bed of Socialism,--will stand for a war of invasion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat started the Doctor off. He flayed the theorists, the people who\\r\\nreasoned with their emotions and not their brains, the mob that looked\\r\\nat externals, and never saw the fires beneath, the throng that was\\r\\nunable to understand anything outside its own horizon, the mass that\\r\\npretended to read the history of the world, and because it changed its\\r\\nclothes imagined that it had changed its spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I\\'ve lived in Germany,\" he cried. \"I was educated there. I know\\r\\nthem. I have the misfortune to understand them. They\\'ll stick together\\r\\nand Socialism go hang--as long as there is a hope of victory. The\\r\\nConfederation was cemented in the blood of victory. It can only be\\r\\ndissolved in the blood of defeat. They are a great, a well-disciplined,\\r\\nand an obedient people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One would think you admired them and their military system,\" remarked\\r\\nthe Critic, a bit crest-fallen at the attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may not, but I\\'ll tell you one sure thing if you want a good circus\\r\\nyou\\'ve got to train your animals. The Kaiser has been a corking\\r\\nringmaster.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course this got a laugh, and though both Critic and Journalist\\r\\ntried to strike fire again with words like \"democracy\" and\\r\\n\"civilization,\" the Doctor had cooled down, and nothing could stir him\\r\\nagain that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the discord had been sown. I suppose the dinner-table talk was\\r\\nonly a sample of what was going on, in that month, all over the world.\\r\\nIt did not help matters that as the days went on we all realized that\\r\\nthe Doctor had been right--that France was to be invaded, not across\\r\\nher own proper frontier, but across unprotected Belgium. This seemed\\r\\nso atrocious to most of us that indignation could only express itself\\r\\nin abuse. There was not a night that the dinner-table talk was not\\r\\nbitter. You see the Doctor did not expect the world ever to be\\r\\nperfect--did not know that he wanted it to be--believed in the\\r\\nstruggle. On the other hand the Critic, and in a certain sense the\\r\\nJournalist, in spite of their experiences, were more or less Utopian,\\r\\nand the Sculptor and the Violinist purely spectators.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo need to go into the details of the heated arguments. They were only\\r\\nthe echo of what all the world,--that had cradled itself into the\\r\\nbelief that a great war among the great nations had become, for\\r\\neconomic as well as humanitarian reasons, impossible,--were, I\\r\\nimagine, at this time saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs nearly as I can remember it was on August 20th that the climax\\r\\ncame. Liege had fallen. The English Expedition had landed, and was\\r\\nmarching on Belgium. A victorious German army had goose-stepped into\\r\\ndefenseless Brussels, and was sweeping out toward the French frontier.\\r\\nThe French advance into Alsace had been a blunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor remarked that \"the English had landed twelve days too\\r\\nlate,\" and the Journalist drew a graphic, and purely imaginary,\\r\\npicture of the pathos of the Belgians straining their eyes in vain to\\r\\nthe West for the coming of the men in khaki, and unfortunately he let\\r\\nhimself expatiate a bit on German methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spark touched the Doctor off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jove,\" he said, \"all you sentimentalists read the History of the\\r\\nWorld with your intellects in your breeches pockets. War is not a game\\r\\nfor babies. It is war--it is not sport. You chaps think war can be\\r\\nprevented. All I ask you is--why hasn\\'t it been prevented? In every\\r\\ngeneration that we know anything about there have been some pretty\\r\\nfine men who have been of your opinion--Erasmus for one, and how many\\r\\nothers? But since the generations have contented themselves with\\r\\ntalking, and not talked war out of the problem, why, I can\\'t see, for\\r\\nmy part, that Germany\\'s way is not as good as any. She is in to win,\\r\\nand so are all the rest of them. Schools of War are like the Schools\\r\\nof Art you chaps talk so much about--it does not make much difference\\r\\nwhat school one belongs to--the only important thing is making good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One would think,\" said the Journalist, \"that you _liked_ such a war.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t even know that I can deny that. I would not\\r\\ndeliberately _choose_ it. But I am willing to accept it, and I am not\\r\\na bit sentimental about it. I am not even sure that it was not needed.\\r\\nThe world has let the Kaiser sit twenty-five years on a throne\\r\\nannouncing himself as \\'God\\'s anointed.\\' His pretensions have been\\r\\ntreated seriously by all the democracies of the world. What for?\\r\\nPurely for personal gain. We have come to a pass where there is little\\r\\na man won\\'t do--for personal gain. The business of the world, and its\\r\\ndiplomacy, have all become so complicated and corrupt that a large\\r\\npercentage of the brains of honest mankind are little willing to touch\\r\\neither. We need shaking up--all of us. If nothing can make man realize\\r\\nthat he was not born to be merely happy and get rich, or to have a\\r\\nfine old time, why, such a complete upheaval as this seems to me to be\\r\\nnecessary, and for me--if this war can rip off, with its shrapnel, the\\r\\nselfishness with which prosperity has encrusted the lucky: if it can\\r\\nexplode our false values with its bombs: if it can break down our\\r\\nabsurd pretensions with its cannon,--all I can say is that Germany\\r\\nwill have done missionary work for the whole world--herself included.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he had done, we were all on our feet shouting at him, all but\\r\\nthe Lawyer, who smiled into his coffee cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" cried the Critic, in anger, \"one would think you held a brief\\r\\nfor them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do NOT,\" snapped the Doctor, \"but I don\\'t dislike them any\\r\\nmore than I do--well,\" catching himself up with a laugh, \"lots of\\r\\nother people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you mean to tell me,\" said the gentle voice of the Divorcee at\\r\\nhis elbow, \"that you calmly face the idea of the hundreds of\\r\\nthousands of men,--well and strong to-day--dead to-morrow,--the\\r\\nthought of the mothers who have borne their sons in pain, and bred\\r\\nthem in love, only to fling them before the cannon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For what, after all, _are_ we born?\" said the Doctor. \"_Where_ we\\r\\ndie, or _when_ is a trifle, since die we must. But _why_ we die and\\r\\n_how_ is vital. It is not only vital to the man that goes--it is vital\\r\\nto the race. It is the struggle, it is the fight, which, no matter\\r\\nwhat form it takes, makes life worth living. Men struggle for money.\\r\\nFinanciers strangle one another at the Bourse. People look on and\\r\\napplaud, in spite of themselves. That is exciting. It is not\\r\\nuplifting. But for men just like you and me to march out to face death\\r\\nfor an idea, for honor, for duty, that very fact ennobles the race.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said the Lawyer, \"I see. The Doctor enjoys the drama of life,\\r\\nbut he does not enjoy the purely domestic drama.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And out of all this,\" said the Trained Nurse, in her level voice,\\r\\n\"you are leaving the Almighty. He gave us a world full of beauty, full\\r\\nof work, full of interest, and he gave us capacities to enjoy it, and\\r\\nendowed us with emotions which make it worth while to live and to\\r\\ndie. He gave us simple laws--they are clear enough--they mark sharply\\r\\nthe line between good and evil. He left us absolutely free to choose.\\r\\nAnd behold what man has made of it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deny the statement,\" said the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s easy,\" laughed the Journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe,\" said the Doctor, impatiently, \"that no good comes but\\r\\nthrough evil. Read your Bible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to read it with _your_ eyes,\" replied the Journalist,\\r\\nand marched testily down the path toward the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" snapped the Doctor, \"if I read it with _yours_, I should call\\r\\non the Almighty to smite this planet with his fires and send us\\r\\nspinning, a flaming brand through space, to annihilation--the great\\r\\nscheme would seem to me a failure--but I don\\'t believe it is.\" And off\\r\\nhe marched in the other direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lawyer shrugged his shoulders, and suppressed, as well as he\\r\\ncould, a smile. The Youngster, leaning his elbows on his knees,\\r\\nrecited under his breath:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"And as he sat, all suddenly there rolled,\\r\\n     From where the woman wept upon the sod,\\r\\n     Satan\\'s deep voice, \\'Oh Thou unhappy God.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said the Lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked the Violinist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only the last three lines of a great little poem by a little great\\r\\nIrishman named Stephens--entitled \\'What Satan Said.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" said the Lawyer, \"the Doctor is probably right. It all\\r\\ndepends on one\\'s point of view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And one\\'s temperament,\" said the Violinist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And one\\'s education,\" said the Critic.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust here the Doctor came back,--and he came back his smiling self. He\\r\\nmade a dash down the path to where the Journalist was evidently\\r\\nsulking, went up behind him, threw an arm over his shoulder, and led\\r\\nhim back into the circle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here,\" he said, \"you are all my guests. I am unreasonably fond of\\r\\nyou, even if we can\\'t see Life from the same point of view. Man as an\\r\\nindividual, and Man as a part of the Scheme are two different things.\\r\\nI asked you down here to enjoy yourselves, not to argue. I\\r\\napologize--all my fault--unpardonable of me. Come now--we have decided\\r\\nto stay as long as we can--we are all interested. It is not every\\r\\ngeneration that has the honor to sit by, and watch two systems meet\\r\\nat the crossroads and dispute the passage to the Future. We\\'ll agree\\r\\nnot to discuss the ethics of the matter again. If the men marching out\\r\\nthere to the frontier can agree to face the cannon--and there are as\\r\\nmany opinions there as here--surely we can _look on_ in silence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on that agreement we all went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the following day, as we sat in the garden after dinner, our\\r\\nattempts to \"keep off the grass\" were miserably visible. They cast a\\r\\nconstraint on the party. Every topic seemed to lead to the forbidden\\r\\nenclosure. It was at a very critical moment that the Sculptor, sitting\\r\\ncross-legged on a bench, in a real Alma Tadema attitude, filled the\\r\\ndangerous pause with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was in the days of our Lord 1348 that there happened in Florence,\\r\\nthe finest city in Italy--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Violinist, who was leaning against a tree, touched an\\r\\nimaginary mandolin, concluding: \"A most terrible plague.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Critic leaped to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A corking idea,\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mine, mine own,\" replied the Sculptor. \"I propose that what those\\r\\nwho, in the days of the terrible plague, took refuge at the Villa\\r\\nPalmieri, did to pass away the time, we, who are watching the war\\r\\napproach--as our host says it will--do here. Let us, instead of\\r\\ndisputing, each tell a story after dinner--to calm our nerves,--or\\r\\notherwise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first every one hooted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could never tell a story,\" objected the Divorcee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you can,\" declared the Journalist. \"Everybody in the world\\r\\nhas one story to tell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure,\" exclaimed the Lawyer. \"No embargo on subjects?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" smiled the Doctor. \"There is always the Youngster.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You go to blazes,\" was the Youngster\\'s response, and he added: \"No\\r\\nwar stories. Draw that line.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" laughed the Doctor, \"let\\'s make it tales of our own, our\\r\\nnative land.\" And there the matter rested. Only, when we separated\\r\\nthat night, each of us carried a sealed envelope containing a\\r\\nnumbered slip, which decided the question of precedence, and it was\\r\\nagreed that no one but the story-teller should know who was to be the\\r\\nevening\\'s entertainer, until story-telling hour arrived with the\\r\\ncoffee and cigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE YOUNGSTER\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nIT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A BRIDE\\'S NEW HOME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe daytimes were not ever very bad. Short-handed in the pretty\\r\\ngarden, every one did a little work. The Lawyer was passionately fond\\r\\nof flowers, and the Youngster did most of the errands. The Sculptor\\r\\nhad found some clay, and loved to surprise us at night with a new\\r\\ncentre piece for the table, and the Divorcee spent most of her time\\r\\ntending Angele\\'s baby, while the Doctor and the Nurse were eternally\\r\\nfussing over new kinds of bandages and if ever we got together, it was\\r\\nusually for a little reading aloud at tea-time, or a little music. The\\r\\nspirit of discussion seemed to keep as far away before the lights were\\r\\nup as did the spirit of war, and nothing could be farther than that\\r\\n_appeared_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day we were unusually quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of us kept in our rooms in the afternoon. There were those\\r\\nstories to think over, and that we all took it so seriously proved how\\r\\nvery much we had been needing some real thing to do. We got through\\r\\ndinner very comfortably.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was little news in the papers that day except enthusiastic\\r\\naccounts of the reception of the British troops by the French. It was\\r\\nlovely to see the two races that had met on so many battle\\r\\nfields--conquered, and been conquered by one another--embracing with\\r\\nenthusiasm. It was to the credit of all of us that we did not make the\\r\\ninevitable reflections, but only saw the humor and charm of the thing,\\r\\nand remembered the fears that had prevented the plans of tunnelling\\r\\nthe channel, only to find them humorous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coffee had been placed on the table. The Trained Nurse, as usual,\\r\\nsat behind the tray, and we each went and took our cup, found a\\r\\ncomfortable seat in the circle under the trees, where a few yellow\\r\\nlanterns swung in the soft air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Youngster pulled a white head-band with a huge \"Number One\"\\r\\non it, out of his pocket, placed it on his head after the manner of\\r\\nthe French Conscripts, struck an attitude in the middle of the\\r\\ncircle, drew his chair deftly under him, and with the air of an\\r\\nexperienced monologist began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so very many years ago there was a pretty wedding at Trinity\\r\\nChurch in Boston. It was quite the sort of marriage Bostonians believe\\r\\nin. The man was a rising lawyer, rather a sceptic on all sorts of\\r\\nquestions, as most of us chaps pride ourselves on being, when we come\\r\\nout of college. They were married in church to please the Woman. What\\r\\nodds did it make?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were married they had decided to live outside the city.\\r\\nShe wanted a garden and an old house. He did not care where they lived\\r\\nso long as they lived together. Very proper of him, too. They spent\\r\\nthe last year of their engaged life, the nicest year of some girls\\'\\r\\nlives, I have heard--in hunting the place. What they finally settled\\r\\non was an old colonial house with a colonnaded front, and a round\\r\\ntower at each end, standing back from the road, and approached by a\\r\\nwide circular drive. It was large, substantial, with great\\r\\npossibilities, and plenty of ground. It had been unoccupied for many\\r\\nyears, and the place had an evil report, and, at the time when they\\r\\nfirst saw it, appeared to deserve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had looked it over. The situation was healthy. It was convenient to\\r\\nthe city. He could make it in his car in less than forty-five minutes.\\r\\nThey saw what could be done with the place, and did not concern\\r\\nthemselves with _why_ other people had not cared to live there.\\r\\nArchitects, interior decorators, and landscape gardeners were put to\\r\\nwork on it, and, even before the wedding, the place was well on toward\\r\\nits habitable stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they were married, and, quite correctly, went abroad to float in\\r\\na gondola on the Grand Canal--together; to cross the Gemmi--together;\\r\\nto stroll about Pompeii and cross to Capri--together; and then ravage\\r\\nantiquity shops in Paris--together. They returned in the early days of\\r\\na glorious September. The house was ready for its master and mistress\\r\\nto lay the touch of their personality on it, and put in place the\\r\\ntrophies of their Wedding Journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evil look the house once had was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few old trees had been cut down round it to let in the glorious\\r\\nautumn sun all over the house, and when, on their first morning, after\\r\\na good sound, well-earned sleep, they took their coffee on the terrace\\r\\noff the breakfast room, under a yellow awning, they certainly did not\\r\\nthink, if they ever had, of the mysterious rumors against the house\\r\\nwhich had been whispered about when they first bought it. To them it\\r\\nseemed that they had never seen a gayer place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the second night, just as the Woman was putting her book aside,\\r\\nand had a hand stretched out to shut off the light, she stopped--a\\r\\ncarriage was coming up the drive. She sat up, and listened for the\\r\\nbell. It did not ring. After a few moments--as there was absolutely no\\r\\nsound of the carriage passing--she got up, and gently pushed the\\r\\nshutter--her room was on the front--there was nothing there, so,\\r\\nattaching no importance to it, she went quietly to bed, put out her\\r\\nlight, just noticing as she did so, that it was midnight, and went to\\r\\nsleep. In the morning, the incident made so little impression on her,\\r\\nthat she forgot to even mention it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night, by some queer trick of memory, just as she went to\\r\\nbed, the thing came back to her, and she was surprised to find that\\r\\nshe had no sleep in her. Instead of that she kept looking at the\\r\\nclock, and just before twelve, cold chills began to go down her back,\\r\\nwhen she heard the rapid approach of a carriage--this time she was\\r\\nconscious that her hearing was so keen that she knew there were two\\r\\nhorses. She listened intently--no doubt about it--the carriage had\\r\\nstopped at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there was a silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was just convincing herself that there must be some sort of echo\\r\\nwhich made it appear that a team passing in the road had come up the\\r\\ndrive--when she was suddenly sure that she heard a hurried step in the\\r\\ncorridor--it passed the door. Now she was naturally a very\\r\\nunimaginative person, and had never had occasion to know fear. So,\\r\\nafter a bit, she put out her light, saying to herself that a belated\\r\\nservant was busy with some neglected work--nothing more likely--and\\r\\nshe went to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the morning sunlight, the Man\\'s gay companionship, the hundreds\\r\\nof delightful things to do, wiped out that bad quarter of an hour,\\r\\nand again it never occurred to her to mention it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night the remembrance came back so vividly after the Man had\\r\\ngone to his room, that she regretted she had not at least asked him if\\r\\nhe had heard a carriage pass in the night. Of course she was sure that\\r\\nhe had not. He was such a sound sleeper. Besides, it was not\\r\\nimportant. If he had, he would not have been nervous about it. Still,\\r\\nshe could not sleep, and, just before the dining room clock began to\\r\\nchime midnight--she had never heard it before, and that she heard it\\r\\nnow was a proof of how her whole body was listening--again came the\\r\\nrapid tread of running horses. This time every hair stood up on her\\r\\nhead, and before she could control herself, she called out toward the\\r\\nopen door: \"Dearest, are you awake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost before she had the words out he was standing smiling in the\\r\\ndoorway. It was all right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you _think_ you heard a carriage come up the driveway?\" she\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes,\" he replied, \"but I didn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Listen! Is there some one coming along the corridor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed the room quietly, opened the door, and turned on the light.\\r\\n\"No, dear. There is no one there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hadn\\'t you better ring for your man, and have him see if any of the\\r\\nservants are up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down on the edge of the bed, and laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, dear girl,\" he said, \"you and I are a pair of healthy\\r\\npeople. We have happened to hear a noise which we can\\'t explain. Be\\r\\nsure that there is rational explanation. You\\'re not afraid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, no, I really am not,\" she declared, \"but you cannot deny that\\r\\nit is strange. Did you hear it last night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go on, now, with your cross-examination,\" he said. \"Let\\'s go to\\r\\nsleep. At any rate the exhibition is over for to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth night they did not speak in the night any more than they\\r\\nhad in the daytime. But the next day they had a long conversation, the\\r\\ngist of which was this: That they had bought the place, that except\\r\\nfor fifteen minutes at midnight, the place was ideal. They were both\\r\\nlevel-headed, neither believed in anything super-natural. Were they to\\r\\nbe driven out of such a place by so harmless a thing as an\\r\\nunexplained noise? They could get used to it. After a bit it would no\\r\\nmore wake them up,--such was the force of habit--than the ticking of\\r\\nthe clock. To all this they both agreed, and the matter was dropped.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten days they did not mention it, but in all those ten days a sort\\r\\nof crescendo of emotion was going on in her. At first she began to\\r\\nthink of it as soon as bed-time approached; then she felt it intruding\\r\\non her thoughts at the dinner table; then she was unable to sleep for\\r\\nan hour or two after the fifteen minutes had passed, and, finally, one\\r\\nnight, she fled into his room to find him wide awake, just before\\r\\ndawn, and to confess that the shadow of midnight was stretched before\\r\\nand after until it was almost a black circle round the twenty-four\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew it was absurd. She had no intention of being driven out of\\r\\nsuch a lovely place--BUT--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, dear,\" he said. \"Let\\'s break our rule. We neither of us\\r\\nwant company, but let\\'s, at least, have a big week ender, and perhaps\\r\\nwe can prove to ourselves that our nerves are wrong. One thing is\\r\\nsure, if you are going to get pale over it, I\\'ll burn the blooming\\r\\nhouse down before we\\'ll live in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you mind it yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are awake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I am, because I know that you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say that if I slept you wouldn\\'t notice it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On my honor--I should not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a comfort,\" she ejaculated. \"I shall go right to sleep.\" And\\r\\noff she went, and did go to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, in the morning, he insisted on the house-party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me see our list,\" he said. \"Let us have no students of occult; no\\r\\nmen who dabble in laboratory spiritualism; just nice, live, healthy\\r\\npeople who never heard of such things--if possible. You can find\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, dear,\" she explained, \"it would not trouble me if I heard it\\r\\nand you did not--but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, fudge!\" he laughed. \"Just now I should be sure to hear anything\\r\\nyou did, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You old darling,\" she replied, \"then I don\\'t care for it a bit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the same we\\'ll have the house-party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the following Saturday every room in the house was occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight they were all gathered in the long drawing room opening on\\r\\nthe colonnade, and, when the hour sounded, some one was singing. The\\r\\nhost and hostess heard the running horses, as usual, and they were\\r\\nconscious that one or two people turned a listening ear, but evidently\\r\\nno one saw anything strange in it, and no comment was made. It was\\r\\nafter one when they all went up to their rooms, so that evening passed\\r\\noff all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on Sunday night two of the younger guests had gone to sit on the\\r\\nfront terrace, and the older people were walking, in the moonlight, in\\r\\nthe garden at the back. The sweet little girl, who was having her hand\\r\\nheld, got up properly when she heard the carriage coming, and went to\\r\\nthe edge of the terrace to see who was arriving at midnight. She had a\\r\\nfit of nerves as the invisible vehicle and its running horses seemed\\r\\nabout to ride over her. She ran in, trembling with fear, to tell the\\r\\ntale, and of course every one laughed at her, and the matter would\\r\\nhave been dropped, if it had not happened that, just at that moment a\\r\\nvery pale gentleman came stumbling out of the house with the statement\\r\\nthat he wanted a conveyance \"to take him back to town,\" that \"he\\r\\nrefused to sleep in a haunted house,\" that he \"had encountered an\\r\\ninvisible person running along the corridor to his room,\" in fact the\\r\\nfootsteps had as he put it \"passed right through him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host broke into laughter, but he took the bull by the horns--the\\r\\nfacts, as he knew them, were safer than the tales which he knew would\\r\\nrun over the city if he attempted to deny things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, my good people,\" he said, \"there is a little mystery here\\r\\nthat we can\\'t explain. The truth is, there _is_ a story about this\\r\\nhouse. It used to belong to the president of a well-known railroad.\\r\\nThat was twenty-five years ago. They say that one night, when he was\\r\\ndriving from a place he had up country, his team was run into at a\\r\\nrailway crossing five miles from here--one of those grade crossings\\r\\nthat never ought to have been--and he was killed and his horses came\\r\\nhome at midnight. \\'They say\\' that the people who lived here after that\\r\\ndeclared that the horses have come home every midnight since. Now,\\r\\nthere\\'s the story. They don\\'t do any harm. It only takes them a few\\r\\nminutes. They don\\'t even trample the driveway, so why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the same, I want to go back to town,\" said the frightened guest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would stay the night, if I were you,\" said the host. \"They won\\'t\\r\\ncome again until to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, when morning came, every one skipped, and as the last of\\r\\nthem drove away, the Woman put her hand through the Man\\'s arm, and\\r\\nsmiled as she said: \"It\\'s all over. I don\\'t mind a bit. When I heard\\r\\nyou saying last night, \\'They don\\'t even trample the driveway, so why\\r\\nnot?\\' I said to myself, \\'Why not?\\' indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good girl,\" he replied. \"I\\'ll bet my top hat you grow to be proud of\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know that they ever did, but I do know that they still live\\r\\nthere. I went to school with the son, and whenever any one bragged, he\\r\\nused to say, \"Well, we\\'ve _always_ had a ghost. You ain\\'t got that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Youngster threw his lighted cigarette into the air, ran under it,\\r\\ncaught it between his lips, and made a bow, as the Doctor broke into a\\r\\nroar of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that old house,\" he said. \"Jamaica Pond. But see here,\\r\\nYoungster, your idea of ghosts is terribly illogical. It was the _man_\\r\\nwho was killed, not the _horses_. The wrong part of the team walked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You _are_ particular,\" replied the Youngster. \"The man did not come\\r\\nback, and the horses did. I can\\'t split hairs when it\\'s a ghost story.\\r\\nI feel afraid that I have missed my vocation, and that flights in the\\r\\nimagination are more in my line than flights in the air. I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat you think. _I_ think it\\'s a mighty good story. I say, Journalist,\\r\\ndo you think I could sell that story? I\\'ve never earned a dollar in my\\r\\nlife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" laughed the Journalist, \"a dollar is just about what you would\\r\\nget for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been doing that story,\" said the Critic, \"I should have\\r\\nfound a logical explanation for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you would,\" said the Youngster. \"I know one of a haunted\\r\\nhouse on St. James Street which had an explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Doctor cut him short with: \"Come now, you\\'ve done your stunt.\\r\\nNo more stories to-night. Off to bed. You and I are going to take a\\r\\nrun to Paris to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell you to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs every one began to move toward the house, the Violinist remarked,\\r\\n\"I was thinking of running up to Paris myself to-morrow. Any one else\\r\\nwant to go with me?\" The Journalist said that he did, and the party\\r\\nbroke up. As they strolled toward the house the Lawyer was heard\\r\\nasking the Youngster, \"What were the steps in the corridor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" replied the Youngster, \"I suppose on the night that the team\\r\\ncame home there must have been great excitement in the house--every\\r\\none running to and fro and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Journalist\\'s shout of laughter stopped him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Youngster eyed him with shocked surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jupiter!\" cried the Journalist. \"That is the darnedest ghost story\\r\\nI ever heard. Everything and everybody walked but the dead man--even\\r\\nthe carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That isn\\'t _my_ fault,\" said the Youngster, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TRAINED NURSE\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SON OF JOSEPHINE\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A FOUNDLING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was very quiet next day. All the men, except the Critic and\\r\\nthe Sculptor, had made an early and hurried run to Paris. So we saw\\r\\nlittle of each other until we gathered for dinner, and the\\r\\nconversation was calm--in fact subdued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor was especially quiet. No one was really gay except the\\r\\nYoungster. He talked of what he had seen in Paris--the silent\\r\\nstreets--the moods of the women--the sight of officers in khaki flying\\r\\nabout in big touring cars--and no one asked what had really taken them\\r\\nto town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trained Nurse and I had walked to the nearest village, but we\\r\\nbrought back little in the way of news. The only interesting thing we\\r\\nsaw was _Monsieur le Cure_ talking to a handsome young peasant woman\\r\\nin the square before the church. We heard her say, with a sob in her\\r\\nthroat, \"If my man does not come back, I\\'ll never say my prayers\\r\\nagain. I\\'ll never pray to a God who let this thing happen unless my\\r\\nman comes back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will, just the same,\" said the Lawyer. \"One of the strangest\\r\\nfeatures of such a catastrophe is that it steadies a race, especially\\r\\nthe race convinced that it has right on its side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It goes deeper than that,\" said the Journalist. \"It strikes millions\\r\\nwith the same pain, and they bear together what they could not have\\r\\nfaced separately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" remarked the Doctor, \"and that is one reason why I have always\\r\\nmistrusted the effort of people outside the radius of disaster to help\\r\\nin anyway, except scientifically.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is rather a cruel idea,\" commented the Trained Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps. But I believe organized charity even of that sort is usually\\r\\nineffective, and weakens the race that accepts it. I believe victims\\r\\nof such disaster are healthier and come out stronger for facing it,\\r\\ndying, or surviving, as Fate decrees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Keep off the grass,\" cried the Youngster. \"I brought back a car full\\r\\nof books.\" The hint was taken, and we talked of books until the coffee\\r\\ncame out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, the Trained Nurse sat behind the pot, and when we were all\\r\\nserved, she pushed the tray back, folded her strong capable white\\r\\nhands on the edge of the table, and said quietly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Messieurs et Mesdames_\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lit our cigarettes, and she began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first year after I left home and took up nursing. I had a\\r\\nroom at that time in one of the Friendly Society refuges on the lower\\r\\nside of Beacon Hill. It was under the auspices of an Episcopal High\\r\\nChurch in the days of Father Hall, and was rather English in tone.\\r\\nIndeed its matron was an Englishwoman--gentle, round-faced,\\r\\nlace-capped, and very sympathetic. I was very fond of her. I had, as a\\r\\nseamstress, a neat little girl named Josephine.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine was a tiny creature, all grey in tone, with mouse-colored\\r\\nhair. She was a foundling. She had not the least notion who her people\\r\\nwere. Her first recollections were of the orphan asylum where she was\\r\\nbrought up. In her early teens she had been bound out to a\\r\\ndressmaker, who had been kind to her, and, when her first employer\\r\\ndied, Josephine, who had saved a little money, and longed for\\r\\nindependence, began to go out as a seamstress among the women she had\\r\\ngrown to know in the dressmaking establishment, and went to live at\\r\\none of the Christian Association homes for working girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one knows what those boarding houses are--two or three hundred\\r\\ngirls of all ages, from sixteen up, of all temperaments. All girls\\r\\nwilling to submit to control; girls with their gay days and their\\r\\ntragic, girls of ambition, and girls with faith in the future, as well\\r\\nas girls of no luck, and girls with their simple youthful romances.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one loved Josephine.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was by nature a little lady, dainty in her ways, industrious,\\r\\nunrebellious, always ready to help the other girls about their\\r\\nclothes, and a model of a confidant. Every one told her their little\\r\\ntroubles, every one confided their little romances. They were sure of\\r\\na good listener, who never had any troubles or romances of her own to\\r\\nconfide.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know how old Josephine was at that time. She might have been\\r\\ntwenty-five, looked younger, but was perhaps older. She was so tiny,\\r\\nand such a mouse of a thing that she seemed a child, but for her\\r\\nenergy, and her capacity for silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, I fancy, three years after I first knew her that she one\\r\\nevening confided to a group of her intimate friends, as they sat\\r\\ntogether over their sewing, that she was engaged to be married. There\\r\\nwas a great excitement. Little lonely Josephine, so discreet, who had\\r\\nsympathized with the romances of so many of her comrades, had a\\r\\nromance of her own. Such a hugging and kissing as went on, you never\\r\\nsaw, unless you have seen a crowd of such girls together. Every one\\r\\nwas full of questions, and there were almost as many tears shed as\\r\\nquestions asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a carpenter, Josephine told them. She had known him ever since\\r\\nshe was with the dressmaker who took her out of the asylum. He lived\\r\\nin Utica, New York. He had a good job, and they were to be married as\\r\\nsoon as she could get ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Josephine set to work with her nimble fingers to make her\\r\\ntrousseau. During the years she had worked for me, the Matron at the\\r\\nFriendly Society, and many of its patrons had come to know and love\\r\\ndear little Josephine, and in our house there was almost as much\\r\\nexcitement over the news as there was at the Association at the South\\r\\nEnd. All the girls set to work to make something for little Josephine.\\r\\nEvery one for whom she had worked gave her something. One lady gave\\r\\nher black silk for a frock. All the girls sewed a bit of underwear for\\r\\nher. She had sheets and table linen, and all sorts of dainty things\\r\\nwhich her girl friends loved to count over, and admire in the evening\\r\\nwithout the least bit of envy. By the time Spring came Josephine had\\r\\nto buy a new trunk to pack her things away in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told us all that she was going to Utica to be married. What\\r\\nwas the use of his spending his money to come east for her, and pay\\r\\nhis expenses back? That seemed reasonable, and the day was fixed for\\r\\nher departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer trunks were packed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took a night train so that we could all go to the station to see\\r\\nher off, and I am sure that the crowd who saw us kissing her good-bye\\r\\nare not likely to forget the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the girls went home chattering about \"dear little Josephine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn due time came a letter from a place near Utica, where she was, she\\r\\nsaid, on her little \"wedding trip,\" and \"very happy,\" and \"he\" sent\\r\\nhis love, and it was signed with her new name, and she would send us\\r\\nher address as soon as she was settled.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime went by--some months. Then she did send an address, but she did\\r\\nnot write often, and when she did, she said little but that she was\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs nearly as I can remember, it was a year and a half after she left\\r\\nthat news came that Josephine had a son. By that time a great many of\\r\\nthe girls she had known were gone. Changes come fast in such a place.\\r\\nBut there was great rejoicing, and those who had known her found time\\r\\nto make something for dear little Josephine\\'s baby, and the sending of\\r\\nthe things kept up the interest in her for some months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the letters ceased again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t be sure how long it was after that that I received a letter\\r\\nfrom her. She told me that her husband was dead, that she never really\\r\\nhad taken root in Utica, and now that she was alone, with her baby to\\r\\nsupport, she longed to come back to Boston, and asked my advice. Did I\\r\\nthink she could take up her old work?\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the letter at once to the Matron of the Friendly Society--I\\r\\nhappened to be resting between two cases--and we decided that it was\\r\\nsafe. At least between us we could help her make the trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months later she came, and we went to the station to meet her. I\\r\\ncould not see that she had changed a bit. She did not look a day\\r\\nolder, and the bouncing baby she carried in her arms was a darling.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course she could not go back to the Association. That was not for\\r\\nmarried women. But we found her a room just across the street, and in\\r\\nno time, she dropped right back into the place she had left. Every\\r\\nmorning she took the baby boy to the _creche_ and every night she took\\r\\nhim home, and a better cared-for, better loved, more wisely bred\\r\\nyoungster was never born, nor a happier one. Every one loved him just\\r\\nas every one loved Josephine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere I thought Josephine\\'s story ended, and so far as she was\\r\\nconcerned, it did.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the baby was six years old, and forward for his age, the\\r\\nMatron of the Friendly Society came into my room one day, when I was\\r\\nthere to take a longer rest than usual, after a very trying case, and\\r\\ntold me that she was in great distress. A friend of hers, who had been\\r\\nher predecessor, and was now the Matron of an Orphan Asylum in New\\r\\nYork State, was going to the hospital to have a cataract removed from\\r\\nher eye, and had written to ask her to come and take her place while\\r\\nshe was away. She begged me to replace her at the Friendly Society\\r\\nwhile she was gone. As her assistant was a capable young woman, and my\\r\\nrelations with every one were pleasant I was only too glad to consent.\\r\\nShe had always been so good to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was gone a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn her return I noticed that she was distressed about something. I\\r\\ntaxed her with it. She said it was nothing she felt like talking\\r\\nabout. But one evening when Josephine had been sewing for me, after\\r\\nshe was gone, the Matron, who had been in my room, got up, and closed\\r\\nthe door after her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve really got to tell you what is on my mind,\" she said. \"And I am\\r\\nsure that you will look on it as a confidence. You know the asylum\\r\\nwhere I have been is not far from Utica, where Josephine went when she\\r\\nwas married. Well, one day, about a fortnight after I got there, I had\\r\\noccasion to look up the record of a child in the books, and my\\r\\nattention was attracted by a name the same as Josephine\\'s. The\\r\\ncoincidence struck me, and I read the record that on a certain day,\\r\\nwhich as near as I could calculate, must have been a year after\\r\\nJosephine left, a person of her name, written down as a widow, a\\r\\nmember of the Orthodox Church, had adopted a male child a few months\\r\\nold. I was interested. I did not suspect anything, but I asked the\\r\\nassistant matron if she remembered the case. She did, clearly. She\\r\\nsaid the woman was a dear little thing, who had come there shortly\\r\\nbefore, a young widow, a seamstress. She was a lonely little thing,\\r\\nand some one connected with the asylum had given her work, which she\\r\\nhad done so well that she soon had all she needed. She had been\\r\\nemployed in the asylum, and loved children as they did her. The child\\r\\nin question was the son of a woman who had died at its birth, from the\\r\\nshock of an accident which had killed the father. It took a fancy to\\r\\nJosephine, and she wanted to adopt it. The committee took the matter\\r\\nup. The clergyman spoke well of her, as did every one, and they all\\r\\ndecided that she was perfectly able to care for it. So she took the\\r\\nchild. All of a sudden, one day, Josephine went, as she had come.\\r\\nThere was no mystery about it. She told the clergyman that she was\\r\\nhomesick for her old friends, and had gone east, and would write, and\\r\\nshe always has.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I was puzzled. There was no doubt in my mind that it was\\r\\nour little Josephine. Naturally I was discreet. Luckily. I spoke of\\r\\nher to several people who remembered her, and they all called her\\r\\n\\'dear little Josephine\\' just as we had. I talked of her with the\\r\\nclergyman and his wife. I asked questions that were too natural to\\r\\nrouse suspicions, when I told them that I knew her, that the baby was\\r\\nthe dearest and happiest child I knew, and what do you suppose I found\\r\\nout, more by inference than facts?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo need to ask me. Didn\\'t I know?\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine had never been married. There had never been any \"He.\" It\\r\\nall seemed so natural. It did not shock me, as it had the Matron, and\\r\\nI was glad she had told no one but me. Dear little Josephine! Sitting\\r\\nthere in the Association without family, with no friends but her\\r\\npatrons, and those girls whose little romances went on about her! No\\r\\nromances ever came her way. So she had made one all of her own. I\\r\\nproved to the Matron easily that what she had discovered by accident\\r\\nwas not her affair, that to keep Josephine\\'s secret was a virtue, and\\r\\nnot a sin. I was sure of that, for, as I watched her afterwards, I\\r\\nknew that Josephine had played her part in her dream romance so well,\\r\\nthat she no longer remembered that it was not true. She had forgotten\\r\\nshe had not really borne the child she carried so lovingly in her\\r\\narms.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that all?\" asked the Journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all,\" replied the Trained Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jove,\" said the Doctor, \"that is a good story. I wish I had told\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" laughed the Trained Nurse. \"I thought it was a\\r\\nbit in your line.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But fancy the cleverness of the little thing to do all the details up\\r\\nso nicely,\" said the Lawyer. \"She dovetailed everything so neatly.\\r\\nBut what I want to know is whether she planned the baby when she\\r\\nplanned the make-believe husband?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fancy not,\" replied the Nurse. \"One thing came along after another\\r\\nin her imagination, quite naturally.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor little Josephine--it seems to me hard luck to have had to\\r\\nimagine such an every day fate,\" sighed the Divorcee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t pity her,\" snapped the Doctor. \"Poor little Josephine, indeed!\\r\\nLucky little Josephine, who arranged her own romance, and risked no\\r\\ndisillusion. There have been cases where the joys of the imagination\\r\\nhave been more dangerous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are sure she had no disillusion?\" asked the Critic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said the Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And her name was Josephine?\" asked the Divorcee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not, and Utica was not the town,\" replied the Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps her disillusion is ahead of her,\" said the Journalist. \"\\'Say\\r\\nno man\\'--or woman either--\\'is happy until the day of his death.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She _is_ dead,\" said the Nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you she was lucky little Josephine,\" ejaculated the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And she died without telling the boy the truth?\" asked the\\r\\nJournalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The truth?\" repeated the Nurse. \"I\\'ve told you that she had forgotten\\r\\nit. No woman was ever so loved by a son. No mother ever so grieved\\r\\nfor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the son lives?\" asked the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nurse smiled quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night,\" said the Doctor. \"I am going to bed to dream of that. It\\r\\nis a pity some of the rest of us childless slackers had not done as\\r\\nwell as Josephine. She took her risk. She was lucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did,\" replied the Nurse, \"but she did not realize anything of\\r\\nthat. She was too simple, too unanalytic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder?\" said the Critic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not, I know.\" Her eyes fell on the Lawyer, and she caught a\\r\\nlaugh in his eye. \"What does that mean?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Lawyer, \"I was only thinking. She was religious, that\\r\\ndear little Josephine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At least she always went to church.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know the type,\" said the Violinist, gently. \"Accepted what she was\\r\\ntaught, believed it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said the Lawyer, \"that is what I was getting at. Well then,\\r\\nwhen her son meets her _au dela_--he will ask for his father--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or,\" interrupted the Violinist, \"his own mother will claim him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" laughed the Critic. \"It\\'s dollars to doughnuts that she\\r\\nwas \\'dear little Josephine\\' to all the Heavenly Host half an hour\\r\\nafter she entered the \\'gates of pearl.\\' Don\\'t look shocked. That is\\r\\nnot sacrilegious. It is intentions--motives, that are immortal, not\\r\\nfacts. Besides--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t push that idea too far,\" interrupted the Doctor from the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be alarmed. I was only going to say--there are Ik Marvels _au\\r\\ndela_--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew that idea was in your head. Drop it!\" laughed the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anyway,\" said the Violinist, \"if Life is but a dream, she had a\\r\\npretty one. Good night.\" And he went up to bed, and we all soon\\r\\nfollowed him, and I imagine not one of us, as we looked out into the\\r\\nmoonlit air, thought that night of war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CRITIC\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'TWAS IN THE INDIAN SUMMER\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF AN ACTRESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, just as we were sitting down to dinner, the news came\\r\\nthat Namur had fallen. The German army had marched singing into the\\r\\nburning town the afternoon before. The Youngster had his head over a\\r\\nmap almost all through dinner. The Belgians were practically pushed\\r\\nout of all but Antwerp, and the Germans were rapidly approaching the\\r\\nnatural defences of France running from Lille to Verdun, through\\r\\nValenciennes, Mauberge, Hirson and Mezieres.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings were beginning to look serious, although we still insisted on\\r\\nbelieving that the Germans could not break through. One result of the\\r\\nmarch of events was that we none of us had any longer the smallest\\r\\ndesire to argue. Theories were giving way to the facts of every day,\\r\\nbut in our minds, I imagine, we were every one of us asking, \"How\\r\\nlong CAN we stay here? How long will it be wise, even if we\\r\\nare permitted?\" But, as if by common consent, no one asked the\\r\\nquestion, and we were only too glad to sit out in the garden we had\\r\\nall learned to love, and to talk of anything which was not war, until\\r\\nthe Critic moved his chair into the middle of the circle, and began\\r\\nhis tale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me see,\" he remarked. \"I need a property or two,\" and he pulled\\r\\nan envelope out of his pocket and laid it on the table, and, leaning\\r\\nhis elbows on it, began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the Autumn of \\'81 that I last saw Dillon act.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had made a great success that winter, yet, in the middle of the\\r\\nseason, she had suddenly disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were all kinds of newspaper explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she was forgotten by the public that had enthusiastically\\r\\napplauded her, and which only sighed sadly, a year later, on hearing\\r\\nof her death, in a far off Italian town,--sighed, talked a little, and\\r\\nforgot again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt chanced that a few years later I was in Italy, and being not many\\r\\nmiles from the town where I heard that she was buried, and a trifle\\r\\noverstrung by a few months delicious, aimless life in that wonderful\\r\\ncountry, I was taken with a sentimental fancy to visit her grave.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sort of pilgrimage for me, for I had given to Dillon my first\\r\\nboyish devotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of her, and to remember her was to recall her rare charm,\\r\\nher beauty, her success, after a long struggle, and the unexpected,\\r\\ninexplicable manner in which she had abandoned it. It was to recall,\\r\\ntoo, the delightful evenings I had spent under her influence, the\\r\\npleasure I had had in the passion of her \"Juliet,\" the poetic charm of\\r\\nher \"Viola\"; the graceful witchery of her \"Rosalind\"; how I had smiled\\r\\nwith her \"Portia\"; laughed with her \"Beatrice\"; wept with her\\r\\n\"Camille\"; in fact how I had yielded myself up to her magnetism with\\r\\nthat ecstatic pleasure in which one gets the best joys of every\\r\\npassion, because one does not drain the dregs of any.\\r\\n\\r\\nI well remembered her last night, how she had disappeared, how she had\\r\\ngone to Europe, how she had died abroad,--all mere facts known in\\r\\ntheir bareness only to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was hard to find the place where she was buried. But at last I\\r\\nsucceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in a humble churchyard. The grave was noticeable because it was\\r\\nwell kept, and utterly devoid of the tawdry ornamentation inseparable\\r\\nfrom such places in Italy. It was marked by a monument distinctly\\r\\nunique in a European country. It was a huge unpolished boulder, over\\r\\nwhich creeping green vines were growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn its rough surface a cross was cut, and underneath were the words:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Yesterday This Day\\'s Madness did prepare,\\r\\n     To-morrow\\'s Silence, Triumph or Despair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow that I read with stupefaction,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Margaret Dillon and child,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nand the dates\\r\\n\\r\\n\"January, 1843\"\\r\\n\"July 25, 1882.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the doubts and fancies this put into my mind, I no sooner\\r\\nstood beside the spot where the earth had claimed her, than all my old\\r\\ninterest in her returned. I lingered about the place, full of\\r\\nromantic fancies, decorating her tomb with flowers, as I had once\\r\\ndecorated her triumphs, absorbed in a dreamy adoration of her memory,\\r\\nand singing her praise in verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then that I learned the true story of her disappearance,\\r\\nguessed at that of her death, as I did at the identity of the young\\r\\nDominican priest, who sometimes came to her grave, and who finally\\r\\ntold me such of the facts as I know. I can best tell the story by\\r\\npicturing two nights in the life of Margaret Dillon, the two following\\r\\nher last appearance on the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe play had been \"Much Ado.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever had she acted with finer humor, or greater gaiety. Yet all the\\r\\nevening she had felt a strange sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was all over, and friends had trooped round to the stage to\\r\\npraise her, and trooped away, laughing and happy, she felt a strange,\\r\\nsad, unused reluctance to see them go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she sat down to her dressing table, hurriedly removed her\\r\\nmake-up, and allowed herself to be stripped of her stage finery. Her\\r\\nfine spirits seemed to strip off with her character. She shivered\\r\\noccasionally with nervousness, or superstition, and she was strangely\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day she had, for some inexplicable reason, been thinking of her\\r\\ngirlhood, of what her life might have been if, at a critical moment,\\r\\nshe had chosen a woman\\'s ordinary lot instead of work,--or if, at a\\r\\nlater day, she had yielded to, instead of resisted, a great\\r\\ntemptation. All day, as on many days lately, she had wondered if she\\r\\nregretted it, or if, the days of her great triumph having passed,--as\\r\\npass they must,--she should regret it later if she did not yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was probably because,--early in the season as it was--she was\\r\\ntired, and the October night oppressed her with the heat of Indian\\r\\nSummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilently she had allowed herself to be undressed, and redressed in\\r\\ngreat haste. But before she left the theatre she bade every one \"good\\r\\nnight\" with more than her usual kindliness, not because she did not\\r\\nexpect to see them all on Monday,--it was a Saturday night,--but\\r\\nbecause, in her inexplicably sad humour, she felt an irresistible\\r\\ndesire to be at peace with the world, and a still deeper desire to\\r\\nfeel herself beloved by those about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she entered her carriage and drove hurriedly home to the tiny\\r\\napartment where she lived quite alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the supper table lay a note.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shivered as she took it up. It was a handwriting she had been\\r\\naccustomed to see once a year only, in one simple word of greeting,\\r\\nalways the same word, which every year in eighteen had come to her on\\r\\nNew Year\\'s wherever she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was October.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat perfectly still for some minutes, and then resolutely opened\\r\\nthe letter, and read:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Madge:--I am so afraid that my voice coming to you, not\\r\\n     only across so many years, but from another world, may shock\\r\\n     you, that I am strongly tempted not to keep my word to you,\\r\\n     yet, judging you by myself, I feel that perhaps this will be\\r\\n     less painful than the thought that I had passed forgetful of\\r\\n     you, or changed toward you. You were a mere girl when we\\r\\n     mutually promised, that though it was Fate that our paths\\r\\n     should not be the same, and honorable that we should keep\\r\\n     apart, we would not pass out of life, whatever came, without\\r\\n     a farewell word,--a second saying \\'good-bye.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is my fate to say it. It is now God\\'s will. Before it\\r\\n     was yours. It is eighteen years since you chose my honor to\\r\\n     your happiness and mine. To-day you are a famous woman. That\\r\\n     is the consolation I have found in your decision. I\\r\\n     sometimes wonder if Fame will always make up to you for the\\r\\n     rest. A woman\\'s way is peculiar--and right, I suppose. I\\r\\n     have never changed. My son has been a second consolation,\\r\\n     and that, too, in spite of the fact that, had he never been\\r\\n     born, your decision might have been so different. He is a\\r\\n     young man now, strangely like what I was, when as a child,\\r\\n     you first knew me, and he has always been my confidant. In\\r\\n     those first days of my banishment from you I kept from\\r\\n     crying my agony from the housetops by whispering it to him.\\r\\n     His uncomprehending ears were my sole confessional. His\\r\\n     mother cared little for his companionship, and her\\r\\n     invalidism threw him continually into my care. I do not know\\r\\n     when he began to understand, but from the hour he could\\r\\n     speak he whispered your name in his prayers. But it was only\\r\\n     lately that, of himself, he discovered your identity. The\\r\\n     love I felt for you in my early days has grown with me. It\\r\\n     has survived in my heart when all other passions, all\\r\\n     prides, all ambitions, long ago died. I leave you, I hope, a\\r\\n     good memory of me--a man who loved you more than he loved\\r\\n     himself, who for eighteen years has loved you silently, yet\\r\\n     never ceased to grieve for you. But I fear that I have\\r\\n     bequeathed to my son, with the name and estate of his\\r\\n     father, my hopeless love for you. If, by chance, what I fear\\r\\n     be true,--if, when bereft of me, he seeks you out, as be\\r\\n     sure he will,--deal gently with him for his father\\'s sake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"There was an old compact between us, dear. I mention it now\\r\\n     only in the hope that you may not have forgotten--indeed,\\r\\n     in the certainty that you have not. I know you so well.\\r\\n     Remember it, I beg of you, only to ignore it. It was made,\\r\\n     you know, when one of us expected to watch the passing of\\r\\n     the other. This is different. If this reminds you of it, it\\r\\n     reminds you only to warn you that Time cancels all such\\r\\n     compacts. It is my voice that assures you of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"FELIX R.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderneath, written in letters, like, yet so unlike, were the words,\\r\\n\"My father died this morning. F. R.\" and an uncertain mark as though\\r\\nhe had begun to add \"Jr.\" to the signature, and realized that there\\r\\nwas no need.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter fell from her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time she sat silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nDead! She had never felt that he could die while she lived. A\\r\\nknowledge that he was living,--loving her, adoring her hopelessly--was\\r\\nnecessary to her life. She felt that she could not go on without it.\\r\\nFor eighteen years she had compared all other men, all other emotions\\r\\nto him and his love, to find them all wanting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he had died.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the date of the letter. He would be resting in that tomb\\r\\nshe remembered so well, before she could reach the place; that spot\\r\\nbefore which they had often talked of Death, which had no terrors for\\r\\neither of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose. She pushed away her untouched supper, hurriedly drank a\\r\\nglass of wine, and, crossing the hall to her bedroom, opened a tiny\\r\\nbox that stood locked upon her dressing table. She took from it a\\r\\npicture--a miniature. It was of a young man not over twenty-five. The\\r\\nface was strong and full of virile suggestion, even in a picture. The\\r\\neyes were brown, the lips under the short mustache were firm, and the\\r\\nthick, short, brown hair fell forward a bit over the left temple. It\\r\\nwas a handsome manly face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture was dated eighteen years before. It hardly seemed possible\\r\\nthat eighteen years earlier this woman could have been old enough to\\r\\nstir the passionate love of such a man. Her face was still young, her\\r\\nform still slender; her abundant hair shaded deep gray eyes where the\\r\\nspirit of youth still shone. But she belonged, by temperament and\\r\\nprofession, to that race of women who guard their youth marvellously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no tears in her eyes as she sat long into the morning,\\r\\nand, with his pictured face before her, reflected until she had\\r\\ndecided.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had kept his word to her. His \"good bye\" had been loyally said. She\\r\\nwould keep hers in turn, and guard his first night\\'s solitude in the\\r\\ntomb with her watchful prayers. She calculated well the time. If she\\r\\ntravelled all day Sunday, she would be there sometime before midnight.\\r\\nIf she travelled back at once, she could be in town again in season to\\r\\nplay Monday; not in the best of conditions, to be sure, for so hard a\\r\\nrole as \"Juliet,\" but she would have fulfilled a duty that would never\\r\\ncome to her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was near midnight, on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light of the big round harvest moon fell through the warm air,\\r\\nwhich scarcely moved above the graves of the almost forgotten dead in\\r\\nthe country churchyard. The low headstones cast long shadows over the\\r\\nlong grass that merely trembled as the noiseless wind moved over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tall woman in a riding dress stood beside the rough sexton at the\\r\\ndoor of the only large tomb in the enclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had grown into a bent old man since she last saw him, but he had\\r\\nrecognized her, and had not hesitated to obey her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he unlocked and pushed back the great door which moved easily and\\r\\nnoiselessly, he placed his lantern on the steps, and telling her that,\\r\\naccording to a family custom, there were lights inside, he turned\\r\\naway, and left her, to keep his watch near by.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo need to tell her the family customs. She knew them but too well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few moments she remained seated on the step where she had rested\\r\\nto await the opening of the door, on the threshold of the tomb of the\\r\\none man among all the men she had met who had stirred in her heart a\\r\\ngreat love. How she had loved him! How she had feared that her love\\r\\nwould wear his out! How she had suffered when she decided that love\\r\\nwas something more than self-gratification, that even though for her\\r\\nhe should put aside the woman he had heedlessly married years before,\\r\\nthere could never be any happiness in such a union for either of them.\\r\\nHow many times in her own heart she had owned that the woman would not\\r\\nhave had the courage shown by the girl, for the girl did not realize\\r\\nall she was putting aside. Yet the consciousness of his love, in\\r\\nwhich she never ceased to believe, had kept her brave and young.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose and slowly entered the vault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe odor of flowers, the odor of death was about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lifted the lantern from the ground, and, with it raised above her\\r\\nhead, approached the open coffin that rested on the catafalque in the\\r\\ncentre of the tomb and mounted the two steps. She was conscious of no\\r\\nfear, of no dread at the idea of once more, after eighteen years,\\r\\nlooking into the face of the man she had loved, who had carried a\\r\\ngreat love for her into another world. But as she looked, her eyes\\r\\nwidened with fright. She bent lower over him. No cry burst from her\\r\\nlips, but the hand holding the lantern lowered slowly, and she tumbled\\r\\ndown the two steps, and staggered back against the wall, where, behind\\r\\nlettered slides, the dead Richmonds for six generations slept their\\r\\nlong sleep together. Her breast heaved up and down, as if life, like a\\r\\ncaged thing, were striving to escape. Yet no sound came from her\\r\\ncolorless lips, no tears were in her widened eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe realizing sense of departed years had reached her heart at last,\\r\\nand the shock was terrible. With a violent effort she recovered\\r\\nherself. But the firm step, the fearless, hopeful face with which she\\r\\nhad approached the coffin of her dead lover were very different from\\r\\nthe blind manner in which she stumbled back to his bier, and the hand\\r\\nwhich a second time raised the lantern trembled so that its wavering\\r\\nlight shed an added weirdness on the still face, so strange to her\\r\\neyes, and stranger still to her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been a young man when they parted. To her he had remained\\r\\nyoung. Now the hair about the brows was thin and white, the drooping\\r\\nmustache that entirely concealed the mouth was grizzled; lines\\r\\nfurrowed the forehead, outlined the sunken eyes, and gave an added\\r\\nthinness to the nostrils. She bent once more over the face, to her\\r\\nonly a strange cold mask. A painful fascination held her for several\\r\\nminutes, forcing her to mark how love, that had kept her young, proud,\\r\\ncontent in its very existence, had sapped his life, and doubled his\\r\\nyears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe realization bent her slender figure under a load of self-reproach\\r\\nand self-mistrust. She drooped lower and lower above the sad, dead\\r\\nface until she slid to the ground beside him. Heavy tearless sobs\\r\\nshook her slight frame as it stretched its length beside the dead love\\r\\nand the dead dream. The ideal so long treasured in her soul had lost\\r\\nits reality. The present had wiped out the past as a sponge wipes off\\r\\na slate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she had but heeded his warning, and refrained from coming until\\r\\nlater, she would have escaped making a stranger of him forever. Now\\r\\nthe sad, aged face, the dead, strange face which she had seen but five\\r\\nminutes before, had completely obscured in her memory the long-loved,\\r\\nyoung face that had been with her all these years. The spirit whose\\r\\nconsoling presence she had thought to feel upholding her at this\\r\\nmoment made no sign. She was alone in the world, bereft of her one\\r\\nsupporting ideal, alone beside the dead body of one who was a stranger\\r\\nalike to her sight and her emotions; alone at night in an isolation as\\r\\nunexpected as it was terrible to her, and which chilled her senses as\\r\\nif it had come to oppress her forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shadows which she had not noticed before, the dark corners of the\\r\\ntomb, the motionless gleam of the moon as it fell through the open\\r\\ndoor, and laid silently on the floor like light stretched dead, the\\r\\nlow rustle of the wind as if Nature restlessly moved in her sleep,\\r\\ncame suddenly upon her, and brought her--fear. She held her breath as\\r\\nshe stilled her sobs to realize that she alone lived in this city of\\r\\nthe Dead. The chill of fright crept along the surface of her body,\\r\\nwhich still vibrated with her storm of grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed paralyzed. She dared not move.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery sense rallied to her ears in dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly she heard her name breathed: \"Margaret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was whispered in a voice once so familiar to her ears, a voice that\\r\\nused to say, \"Madge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised herself on her elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe dared not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hardly dared breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was afraid in every sense, and yet she hungered for another sound\\r\\nof that loved voice. Every hour of its banishment was regretted at\\r\\nthat moment. There seemed no future without it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery nerve listened.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first she heard nothing but the restless moving of the air, which\\r\\nmerely emphasized her loneliness, then she caught the pulsation of\\r\\nslow regular breathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe started to her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe snatched up the lantern and quickly mounted to the bier. She\\r\\nlooked sharply down into the dead face.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilent, with its white hair, and worn lines, it rested on its white\\r\\npillows.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sound came from the cold still lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, while her eyes were riveted on them, once more the longed-for\\r\\nvoice breathed her name. \"Margaret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came from behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere in the moonlit doorway, with a sad, compassionate smile on his\\r\\nstrong, young face--as if it were yesterday they had parted--stood the\\r\\nman she remembered so well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer bewildered eyes turned from the silent, unfamiliar face among the\\r\\nsatin cushions, to the living face in the moonlight,--the young, brown\\r\\neyes, the short, brown hair falling forward over the left temple, the\\r\\nerect, elastic figure, the strong loving hands stretching out to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was so tired, so heart sick, so full of longing for the love she\\r\\nhad lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Felix,\" she sobbed, and, blindly groping to reach what she feared\\r\\nwas a hallucination, she stumbled down the steps, and was caught up in\\r\\nthe arms flung wide to catch her, and which folded about her as if\\r\\nforever. She sighed his name again, upon the passionate young lips\\r\\nwhich had inherited the great love she had put aside so long before.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the last words died away, the Critic drew himself up and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had told the story very dramatically, reading the letter from the\\r\\nenvelope he had called a \"property,\" and he had told it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laugh broke the spell, and the Doctor echoed it heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, old man,\" said the Critic, \"you owed me that laugh. You\\'re\\r\\nwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was only thinking,\" said the Doctor, his face still on a broad\\r\\ngrin, \"that we have always thought you ought to have been a novelist,\\r\\nand now we know at last just what kind of a novelist you would have\\r\\nbeen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you believe it,\" said the Critic, \"That was only\\r\\nimprovisatore--that\\'s no sample.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho, ho! I\\'ll bet you anything that the manuscript is up in your\\r\\ntrunk, and that you have been committing it to memory ever since this\\r\\nidea was proposed,\" said the Doctor, still laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, _that_ I deny,\" replied the Critic, \"but as I am no _poseur_, I\\r\\nwill own that I wrote it years ago, and rewrote it so often that I\\r\\nnever could forget it. I\\'ll confess more than that, the story has been\\r\\n\\'declined with thanks\\' by every decent magazine in the States and in\\r\\nEngland. Now perhaps some one will tell me why.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know the answer,\" said the Youngster, seriously, \"unless it\\r\\nis \\'why not?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shouldn\\'t wonder if it were sentimental twaddle,\" sighed the\\r\\nJournalist, \"but I don\\'t _know_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I noticed,\" expostulated the Critic, \"that you all listened,\\r\\nenthralled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" replied the Doctor, \"that was a tribute to your personal charm.\\r\\nYou did it very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" said the Critic, \"if editors would let me read them my\\r\\nstories, I could sell them like hot cakes. I never believed that Homer\\r\\nwould have lived as long as he has, if he had not made the reputation\\r\\nof his tales by singing them centuries before any one tried to read\\r\\nthem. Now no one _dares_ to say they bore him. The reading public, and\\r\\nthe editors who cater to it, are just like some stupid theatrical\\r\\nmanagers I know of, who will never let an author read a play to them\\r\\nfor fear that he may give the play some charm that the fool theatrical\\r\\nman might not have felt from mere type-written words on white or\\r\\nyellow paper. By Jove, I know the case of a manager who once bought\\r\\nthe option on a foreign play from a scenario provided by a clever\\r\\nfriend of mine--and paid a stiff price for it, too, and when he got\\r\\nthe manuscript wrote to the chap who did the scenario--\\'Play\\r\\ndashety-dashed rot. If it had been as good as your scenario, it would\\r\\nhave gone.\\' And, what is more, he sacrificed the tidy five thousand he\\r\\nhad paid, and let his option slide. Now, when the fellow who did the\\r\\nscenario wrote: \\'If you found anything in the scenario that you did\\r\\nnot discover in the play, it is because I gave you the effect it would\\r\\nhave behind the footlights, which you have not the imagination to see\\r\\nin the printed words,\\' the Manager only replied \\'You are a nice chap.\\r\\nI like you very much, but you are a blanketty-blanketty fool.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which was right?\" asked the Journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The scenario man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do I know? Why simply because the play was produced later--ran\\r\\nfive years, and drew a couple of million dollars. That\\'s how I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By cricky,\" exclaimed the Youngster, \"I believe he thinks his story\\r\\ncould earn a million if it had a chance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t say \\'no,\\'\" said the Critic, yawning, \"but it will never get a\\r\\nchance. I burned the manuscript this morning, and now being delivered\\r\\nof it, I have no more interest in it than a sparrow has in her last\\r\\nyear\\'s offspring.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The trouble with you is that you haven\\'t any patience, any staying\\r\\npower. That ought to have been a three volume novel. We would have\\r\\nheard all about their first meeting, their first love, their\\r\\nseparation, his marriage, her _debuts_, etc., etc.,\" declared the\\r\\nJournalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, thunder,\" said the Doctor. \"I think there was quite enough of it.\\r\\nDon\\'t throw anything at me--I liked it--I liked it! Only I\\'m sorry she\\r\\ndied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So am I,\" said the Critic. \"That really hurt me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" said the Doctor, shying away toward the door, \"I should\\r\\nhave liked to know if the child turned out to be a genius. That kind\\r\\ndo sometimes,\" and he disappeared into the doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anyhow,\" said the Critic, \"I am going to wear laurels until some one\\r\\ntells a better--and I\\'d like to know why the Journalist looks so\\r\\npensively thoughtful?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am trying to recall who she was--Margaret Dillon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t fret--she may be a \\'poor thing,\\' but she is all \\'mine own\\'--a\\r\\ngenuine creation, Mr. Journalist. I am no reporter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah? Then you are more of a sentimentalist than I even dared to\\r\\ndream.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t deny it,\" said the Critic, as he rose and yawned. \"So I am\\r\\ngoing to bed to sleep on my laurels while I may. Good night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" called the Sculptor after him, as he sauntered away, \"as one\\r\\nof our mutual friends used to say \\'The Indian Summer of Passion\\r\\nscorches.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, alas!\" added the other, \"it does not _always_ kill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witness--\" began the Journalist, but the Critic cut him short.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you love me--not that famous list of yours including so many of\\r\\nthe actresses we all know. I can\\'t bear THAT to-night. After\\r\\nall the French have a better phrase for it--\\'La Crise de quarante\\r\\nans.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nurse and Divorcee had been very quiet, but here they locked\\r\\nhands, and the former remarked that they prepared to withdraw:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is our cue to disappear--and you, too, Youngster. These men are\\r\\nfar too wise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we of the discussed sex made a circle with our clasped hand about\\r\\nthe Youngster and danced him into the house. The last I saw of the\\r\\ngarden that night, as I looked out of my window toward the northeast,\\r\\nwith \"Namur\" beating in my head, the five men had their heads still\\r\\ntogether, but whether \"the other sex\" was getting scientifically torn\\r\\nto bits, or they, too, had Namur in their minds I never knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DOCTOR\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nAS ONE DREAMS\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF AN ADOLESCENT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day was very peaceful. We were becoming habituated to the\\r\\nsituation. It was a Sunday, and the weather was warm. There had been\\r\\nno real news so far as we knew, except that Japan had lined up with\\r\\nthe Allies. The Youngster had come near to striking fire by wondering\\r\\nhow the United States, with her dislike for Japan, would view the\\r\\nentering into line of the yellow man, but the spark flickered out, and\\r\\nI imagine we settled down for the story with more eagerness than on\\r\\nthe previous evening, especially when the Doctor thrust his hands into\\r\\nhis pockets and lifted his chin into the air, as if he were in the\\r\\ntribune. More than one of us smiled at his resemblance to Pierre Janet\\r\\nentering the tribune at the _College de France_, and the Youngster\\r\\nsaid, under his breath, \"A _Clinique_, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor\\'s ears were sharp. \"Not a bit,\" he answered, running his\\r\\nkeen brown eyes over us to be sure we were listening before he began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days when it was thought that the South End was to be the smart\\r\\npart of Boston, and when streets were laid out along wide tree shaded\\r\\nmalls, with a square in the centre, in imitation of some quarters of\\r\\nLondon,--for Boston was in those days much more English in appearance\\r\\nthan it is now,--there was in one of those squares a famous private\\r\\nschool. In those days it was rather smart to go to a private school.\\r\\nIt was in the days before Boston had much of an immigrant quarter,\\r\\nwhen some smart families still lived in the old Colonial houses at the\\r\\nNorth End, and ministers and lawyers and all professional men sent\\r\\ntheir sons and their daughters to the public schools, at that time\\r\\nprobably the best in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this private school, there was, at the time of which I speak, what\\r\\none might almost call a \"principal girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was the daughter of a rich banker--his only daughter. The gods all\\r\\nseemed to have been very good to her. She was not only a really\\r\\nbeautiful girl, she was, for her age, a distinguished girl,--one of\\r\\nthe sort who seemed to do everything better than any one else, and\\r\\nwith a lack of self-consciousness or pretension. Every one admired\\r\\nher. Some of her comrades would have loved her if she had given them\\r\\nthe chance. But no one could ever get intimate with her. She came and\\r\\nwent from school quite alone, in the habit of the American girl of\\r\\nthose days before the chaperon became the correct thing. She was\\r\\ncharming to every one, but she kept every one a little at arm\\'s\\r\\nlength. Of course such a girl would be much talked over by the other\\r\\ntype of girl to whom confidences were necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs always happens in any school there was a popular teacher. She\\r\\ntaught history and literature, and I imagine girls get more intimate\\r\\nwith such a teacher than they ever do with the mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, as always happens, there was a \"teacher\\'s pet,\" one of those\\r\\ngirls that has to adore something, and the literature teacher, as she\\r\\nwas smart and good looking, was as convenient to adore as anything\\r\\nelse,--and more adjacent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course \"teacher\\'s pet\" never has any secrets from the teacher, and\\r\\ndoes not mean to be a sneak either. Just can\\'t help turning herself\\r\\ninside out for her idol, and when the heart of a girl of seventeen\\r\\nturns itself inside out, almost always something comes out that is not\\r\\nher business. That was how it happened that one day the literature\\r\\nteacher was told that the \"Principal Girl\" was receiving wonderful\\r\\nboxes of violets at the school door, and \"Don\\'t you know ONE\\r\\nDAY she was seen by a group of pupils who happened to be going\\r\\nhome, and were just behind her, getting into a closed carriage and\\r\\ndriving away from the corner of the street!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the literature teacher did not, as a rule, encourage such\\r\\nconfidences, but this time it seemed useful. She liked the Principal\\r\\nGirl--admired her, in fact. She was terribly shocked. She warned her\\r\\npet to talk to no one else, and then she went at once to the clergyman\\r\\nwho was at the head of the school. She knew that he felt responsible\\r\\nfor his pupils, and this had an unpleasant look. He took the pains to\\r\\nverify the two statements. Then there was but one thing to do--to lay\\r\\nthe matter before the parents of the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as so often happens in American families, the banker and his wife\\r\\nstood in some awe of their daughter. There was not that confidence\\r\\nbetween them which one traditionally supposes to exist between parents\\r\\nand children. I imagine that there is no doubt that the adolescent\\r\\nfinds it much easier to confide in some one other than the parents who\\r\\nwould seem to be her proper confidants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate the banker and his wife were simply staggered. They dared\\r\\nnot broach the subject to the Principal Girl, and in their distress\\r\\nturned to the family lawyer. As they were too cowardly to take his\\r\\nfirst advice--perhaps they were afraid the daughter would lie, they\\r\\nsometimes do in the best regulated families,--it was decided to put a\\r\\ndiscreet person \"on the job,\" and discover first of all what was\\r\\nreally going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of the investigation was at first consoling, and then\\r\\namazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey discovered that the bunches of violets were ordered at a smart\\r\\ndown town florist by the girl herself, and by her order delivered at\\r\\nthe school door by a liveried messenger boy, who, by her orders,\\r\\nawaited her arrival. As for the closed carriage, that she also bespoke\\r\\nherself at a smart livery stable where she was known. When she entered\\r\\nit, she was at once driven to the Park Street station, where she\\r\\nbought a round trip ticket to Waltham. There she walked to the river,\\r\\nhired a boat, rowed herself up stream, tied her boat at a wooden bank,\\r\\nclimbed the slope, and sat there all the afternoon, sometimes reading,\\r\\nand sometimes merely staring out at the river, or up at the sky. At\\r\\nsunset she rowed back to the town, returned to the city, and walked\\r\\nfrom the station to her home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis all seemed simple enough, but it puzzled the father, it made him\\r\\nunquiet in his mind. Why all this mystery? Why--well, why a great many\\r\\nthings, for of course the Principal Girl had to prepare for these\\r\\nabsences, and, although the little fibs she told were harmless\\r\\nenough--well, why? The literature teacher, who had been watching her\\r\\ncarefully, had her theory. She knew a lot about girls. Wasn\\'t she once\\r\\none herself? So it was by her advice that the family doctor was taken\\r\\ninto the family confidence, chiefly because neither father nor mother\\r\\nhad the pluck to tackle the matter--they were ashamed to have their\\r\\ndaughter know that she had been caught in even a small deception--it\\r\\nseemed so like intruding into her intimate life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are parents like that, you know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor had known the girl since he ushered her into the world. If\\r\\nthere were any one with whom she had shown the slightest sign of\\r\\nintimacy, it was with him. Like all doctors whose associations are so\\r\\nlargely with women, and who are moderately intelligent and\\r\\ntemperamental, he knew a great deal about the dangers of the\\r\\nimagination. No one ever heard just what passed between the two. One\\r\\nthing is pretty sure, he made no secrets regarding the affair, and at\\r\\nthe end of the interview he advised the parents to take the girl out\\r\\nof school, take her abroad, keep her active, present her at courts,\\r\\nshow her the world, keep her occupied, interest her, keep her among\\r\\npeople whether she liked it or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe literature teacher counted for something in the affair, and I\\r\\nimagine that it was never talked over between the parents and\\r\\ndaughter, who soon after left town for Europe, and for three years\\r\\nwere not seen in Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they _did_ return, it was to announce the marriage of the\\r\\nPrincipal Girl to the son of the family lawyer, a clever man, and a\\r\\nrising politician.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelations between the literature teacher and the Principal Girl had\\r\\nnever wholly broken off, so ten years after the school adventure it\\r\\nhappened one beautiful day in early September that the teacher was a\\r\\nguest at the North Shore summer home of the Principal Girl, now the\\r\\nmother of two handsome boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon at tea, sitting on the verandah, watching the white\\r\\nsails as the yachts made for Marblehead harbor, and the long line of\\r\\nsurf beating against the rugged rocks beyond the wide pebbly beach on\\r\\nwhich the dragging stones made weird music, the literature teacher,\\r\\nsupposing the old story to be so much ancient history that it could,\\r\\nas can so many of the incidents of one\\'s teens, be referred to\\r\\nlightly, had the misfortune to mention it. To her horror, the\\r\\nPrincipal Girl gave her one startled look, and then rolled over among\\r\\nthe cushions of the hammock in which she was swinging, and burst into\\r\\na torrent of tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the paroxysm had passed, she sat up, wiped her eyes in which,\\r\\nhowever, there was no laughter, and said passionately:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you think me the most ungrateful woman in the world. I know\\r\\nonly too well that to many women my position has always appeared\\r\\nenviable. Poor things, if they only knew! Of course, my husband is a\\r\\ngood man. In all ways I do him perfect justice. He is everything that\\r\\nis kind and generous--only, alas, he is not the lover of my dreams. My\\r\\nchildren are nice handsome boys, but they are the every day children\\r\\nof every day life. I dreamed another and a different life in which my\\r\\nchildren were oh, so different, and beside which the life I try to\\r\\nlead with all the strength I have is no more like the life I dreamed\\r\\nthan my boys are like my dream children. If you think it has not taken\\r\\ncourage to play the part I have played, I am sorry for your lack of\\r\\ninsight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she got up, and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as well, for, as the literature teacher told the doctor\\r\\nafterward, it was one notch above her experience, and she absolutely\\r\\ncould have found no word to say. When the Wife came back to the\\r\\nhammock, ten minutes later, the cloud was gone from her face, and she\\r\\nnever mentioned the subject again. And you may be sure that the\\r\\nliterature teacher never did. She always looked upon the incident as\\r\\nher worst moment of tactlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bully, bully!\" exclaimed the Lawyer, \"Take off your laurels, Critic,\\r\\nand crown the Doctor!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For that little tale,\" shouted the Critic. \"Never! That has not a bit\\r\\nof literary merit. It has not one rounded period.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lawyer is a realist,\" said the Sculptor. \"Of course that appeals\\r\\nto him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you want my opinion, I consider that there is just as much\\r\\nimagination in that story as in the morbid rigmarole you threw at us\\r\\nlast night,\" persisted the Lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" declared the Critic, \"I call mine a healthy story compared with\\r\\nthis one. It is a shocking tale for the operating room--I mean the\\r\\ninsane asylum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" laughed the Doctor, \"then we had all better go inside the\\r\\nsanitarium walls at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you presume,\" said the Journalist, \"to pretend that this is a\\r\\nnormal incident?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going into that. I only claim that more people know the\\r\\ncondition than dare to confess it. It is after all only symbolic of\\r\\nthe duality of the soul--or call it what you like. It is the\\r\\nembodiment of a truth which no one thinks of denying--that the spirit\\r\\nhas its secrets. Imagination plays a great part in most of our\\r\\nlives--it is the glory that gilds our facts--it is the brilliant\\r\\nbarrier which separates us from the beasts, and the only real thing\\r\\nthat divides us into classes, though, of course, it does not run\\r\\nthrough the world like straight lines of latitude and longitude, but\\r\\nlike the lines of mean temperature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The truth is,\" said the Lawyer, \"if the Principal Girl had been\\r\\nobliged to struggle for her living, the fact that her imagination did\\r\\nnot run at any point into her world of realities would not have been\\r\\ndangerous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naturally not,\" said the Doctor, \"for she would have been a great\\r\\nnovelist, or a poor one, and all would have been well, or not,\\r\\naccording to circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the same,\" persisted the Critic, \"I think it a horrid story\\r\\nand--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" interrupted the Doctor, \"that you have a vicious mind,\\r\\nand--\" Here the Doctor cast a quick look in the direction of the\\r\\nYoungster, who was stretched out in a steamer chair and had not said a\\r\\nword.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said the Trained Nurse, \"he is fast asleep.\" And so he\\r\\nwas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as well,\" said the Doctor, \"though it does not speak so well for\\r\\nthe story as it might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" laughed the Journalist, \"you have had a double success,\\r\\nDoctor. You have been spontaneously applauded by the man of law, and\\r\\nsent the man of the air to _faire dodo_. I reckon you get the\\r\\nlaurels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you be in such a hurry to award the palm,\" protested the\\r\\nSculptor. \"There are some of us who have not spoken yet. I am going to\\r\\nput some brilliant touches on mine before I give my star performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that about stars?\" yawned the Youngster, waking up slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing except that you have given a very distinguished and\\r\\nunexpected star performance as a sleeper,\" said the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say!\" he exclaimed, sitting up. \"By Jove, is the story of the\\r\\nPrincipal Girl all told? That\\'s a shame. What became of her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll never know now,\" said the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Besides,\" said the Critic, \"you would not understand. You are too\\r\\nyoung.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I like your cheek.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" said the Journalist, \"it is only another phase of the\\r\\nDear Little Josephine, and I still think that is the banner story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me, too,\" said the Doctor, as we went into the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I thought to myself, \"I can tell a third phase--the tragic--when\\r\\nmy turn comes,\" and I was the only one who knew that my story would\\r\\ncome last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SCULPTOR\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nUNTO THIS END\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A VIRGIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on August 26th that we were first sure that the Allied forces\\r\\nand the German army had actually come in contact. It seemed impossible\\r\\nfor us to realize it, but, in the afternoon the Doctor, the Lawyer,\\r\\nand the Youngster took one of the cars, and made a run to the\\r\\nnortheast. The news they brought back did not at all coincide with the\\r\\nhopeful tone of the morning papers. In fact it was not only evident\\r\\nthat the fall of Namur had been followed almost immediately by that of\\r\\nMons and Charleroi, but that the German hordes were well over the\\r\\nFrench frontier, and advancing rapidly, and the Allied armies simply\\r\\nflying before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe odd part was, that though the Youngster said that they had only\\r\\nrun out fifty miles, they had heard the guns, and \"the Doctor\\r\\nthinks,\" he added, under his breath, \"that we may be able to stick it\\r\\nout to the last day of the month. Anyway, I advise you girls to look\\r\\nover your kits. We may fly in a hurry--such of us as must fly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we managed to get through dinner quite gaily. We simply could\\r\\nnot realize the menace, and the Doctor evidently meant that we should\\r\\nnot. He was in gayer spirits than he had been since the days of the\\r\\ngreat discussions, and after the few facts he had brought back were\\r\\ngiven us, he kept the talk on other matters, until the Sculptor, who\\r\\nhad been lying back in his chair, blowing smoke rings in the air,\\r\\nstretched himself into his most graceful position, and called\\r\\nattention even to his pose, before he threw his cigarette far from him\\r\\nwith a fine gesture, settled his handsome head into his clasped hands,\\r\\nand began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been ten years abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all that time I had been idle, prosperous, and wretched.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time Fate wrenched my heart with one of her long thin pitiless\\r\\nhands, she recompensed me with what the world calls \"good luck.\"\\r\\nEvery hope I had cherished failed me. Every faith I had harbored\\r\\ndeserted me. Every venture in which neither heart nor soul was\\r\\nconcerned flourished and flaunted its success in the face of the\\r\\nworld, where I was considered a very fortunate man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ten years of my exile I had travelled much, had been in contact\\r\\nwith all kinds of people, had served some, and tried in vain to be\\r\\nconcerned for them while I served. If it had been my fate to make no\\r\\nfriends, it was within my choice to be never alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had that in my memory which I hoarded, and yet with which I would\\r\\nnot allow myself to be deliberately alone. The most terrible hours of\\r\\nmy life were those when, toward morning, the rest of the world--all\\r\\nthe world save me--having no past to escape, no enticing phantom to\\r\\nflee, went peacefully off to bed, and I was left alone in the night to\\r\\ndrug memory, fight off thought, outwit imagination by any means that I\\r\\nmight--and some of them were desperate enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen years had passed thus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother tenth of August had come round!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a man who has but one anniversary in his life, the backward and\\r\\nforward shadows of which make an unbroken circle over the whole year,\\r\\ncan appreciate my existence. One cannot escape such a date. You may\\r\\nnever speak of it. You may forswear calendars, abjure newspapers,\\r\\nrefuse to date a letter; you may even lose days in a drunken stupor.\\r\\nStill there is that in your heart and your brain which keeps the\\r\\nreckoning. The hour will strike, in spite of you, when the day comes\\r\\nround on the dial of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been living for some time in a city far distant from my native\\r\\nland. Half the world stretched on either side between me and the spot\\r\\nI tried to forget, and which floated forever, like a vision, between\\r\\nme and reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had remained longer than usual in this city, for the simple reason\\r\\nthat it was the hot season, and while the natives could stand it by\\r\\nday, visitors, unused to the heat, were forced to sleep by day and\\r\\nwander abroad by night, a condition that made it possible for me to\\r\\nfeel my fellowmen about me nearly the entire twenty-four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was sitting alone on the balcony of my room, looking down on to the\\r\\ncrowded bridges of the city where throngs were passing, and filled my\\r\\neyes and mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the very hour at which I had last seen her. There was no clock\\r\\nin sight--I always guarded against that in selecting my room. I had\\r\\nlong ceased to carry a watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I knew the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been sitting there for hours watching the crowd. I had not been\\r\\ndrinking. I had long ago abandoned that. No stimulant could blur the\\r\\nfixed regret, no narcotic numb my full sense of it. Sleep, whether I\\r\\nrose to it, or fell to it--only brought me dreams of her. Desperate\\r\\nnourishing of a great misery, in a nature that resented it, even while\\r\\ncherishing it, had made me a conscious monomaniac. Fate had thwarted\\r\\nme, and distorted me. I had become jealous and morbid, bitterly\\r\\nreviling my hurt, but violently preventing its healing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moon--just as there had been that night, only now it fell\\r\\non a many bridged river across which were ghostly cypress trees,\\r\\nrising along the hillside to a strangely outlined church behind ruined\\r\\nfortifications. I was wondering, against my will, at what hour that\\r\\nmoon rose over the distant New England village, which came before me\\r\\nin a vision that wiped out the wooded heights of reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly all the pain dropped away from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drew a long breath in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere was the weight under which I had staggered, mentally, all these\\r\\nyears? Whence came the peace that had so suddenly descended upon me?\\r\\nIn an instant it had passed, and I could only remember my bitter mood\\r\\nof ten years as if it had been a dream that I had lived so long\\r\\nunconsoled by that great healer, Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the torturing jealousy dropped from me, a gentle sadness took its\\r\\nplace. In an instant my mind was made up. I would go back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idea, which had never come to me in ten years, seemed now\\r\\nperfectly natural. I would return at once to that far off village\\r\\nwhere, for a brief hour, I had dwelt in a \"Fool\\'s Paradise,\" through\\r\\nwhich my way had lain but a brief span, and where I had passed, like\\r\\nthe fabled bird, that \"floats through Heaven, but cannot light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember but little of the journey home, save that it was long, and\\r\\nthat I slept much. But whether it was months or years I never knew. I\\r\\nseemed to be making up what I had lost in ten years. Time occupied\\r\\nitself in restoring the balance I had taken so much pains to upset.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was night when I reached the place at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found it as I had left it. Had a magic sleep settled there it could\\r\\nnot have been less changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was recognized in the small bare office of the one tavern. I felt\\r\\nthat my sudden appearance surprised no one. But I did not wonder why.\\r\\n\\r\\nOddly enough, I never asked a question. I had not even questioned\\r\\nmyself as to what I expected to find. Years afterward I was convinced,\\r\\nin reviewing the matter, that my soul had known from the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dined alone, quite calmly, after which I stepped out into the\\r\\nstarlight. I turned up the hill, and struck into the familiar road I\\r\\nhad so often travelled in the old days. It led toward the river, and\\r\\nalong the steep bank of the rapid noisy stream. The chill wind of an\\r\\nearly autumn night moaned sadly in the tall trees, and the dead leaves\\r\\nunder my feet rustled a sad accompaniment to my thoughts, which at\\r\\nlast, unhooded, flew back to the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow rushed the river, whose torrent had ever been an accompaniment\\r\\nto all my recollections of her--as inseparable from them as the color\\r\\nof her eyes, or the tones of her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not but contrast my present calm with the mad humor in which I\\r\\nhad last rushed down the slope I was so quietly climbing. As I went\\r\\nforward, I began to ask myself, \"Why?\" I could not answer that, but I\\r\\nbegan to hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon had emerged above the trees on the opposite side of the\\r\\nriver. It struck and illumined something white above me. I was\\r\\nstanding exactly where I had stood on that fatal tenth of August, so\\r\\nmany years before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came to my senses as if by an electric shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last everything was clear to me. At last I understood whence had\\r\\ngone all my vanity and jealousy. At last I understood the spell of\\r\\npeace that had settled on me in that moonlit tenth of August, in that\\r\\nfar off city.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy burden had passed through the Valley of the Shadow of Death with\\r\\nher--for I was standing at the door of her tomb!\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not question. I knew, I comprehended.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn no other way could I have found such calm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I flung myself on the shining marble steps that led in the\\r\\nmoonlight up to the top of the knoll where the tomb stood, I had no\\r\\ntears to shed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present floated still further away.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the rush of the torrent died out of my ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more it seemed to me that lovely day in May when we three had\\r\\nmarched, shoulder to shoulder, down the city street--that spring day\\r\\nin the early sixties, when the North was sending her flower to fight\\r\\nfor a united country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain I felt the warm sunshine on my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more I heard the ringing cheers, saw the floating flags, and the\\r\\nfaces of women who wept as well as women who smiled in the throngs\\r\\nthat lined the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as in all my life it had been his emotions and his enthusiasms\\r\\nthat led me, it was his excitement that impelled me forward at this\\r\\nmoment. His was the hand that in my school days, at college, in our\\r\\nBohemian days abroad, had swept my responsive nature as a master hand\\r\\nstrikes a harp, and made harmonies or discords at his will--or, I\\r\\nshould say, according to his mood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI used to think in those days that he never willfully wronged any one,\\r\\nbut I had to own also that he never deliberately sacrificed himself\\r\\nfor any one. And, if I were the victim of his temperament, he was no\\r\\nless so. But he was an artist. I was not. All things either good or\\r\\nbad were merely material to him. With me it was different.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe and I were alone in the world. But beside us marched, that May\\r\\nmorning, with the glory of youth on his handsome but weak face, one\\r\\nwhose \"baptism of fire\" was to make him a hero, who had else been\\r\\nremembered a coward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the girl he had wronged, and fear of whom had even\\r\\nreconciled his family to his enlisting, was common property, and had\\r\\nbeen for several seasons. There was a child, too, a little daughter,\\r\\nfondly loved, but unacknowledged, the fame of whose childish beauty\\r\\nmany a heedless voice had already sung.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, poor youngster, looked on his all that morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more I saw the flag draped house where his mother waved a brave\\r\\nfarewell to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was another later picture in my mind. Again I heard the\\r\\nblare of the band before us as it flung its satire of \"The Girl I Left\\r\\nBehind Me,\" into the spring air. I saw once more in my mind the child,\\r\\nwith her floating red gold curls, raised above the crowd on the\\r\\nshoulders of tall men. Her eyes were too young for tears--and for that\\r\\nmatter, tears came to her but seldom in later years--and the lips that\\r\\nshouted \"bood-bye\" smiled, unconscious of bravery, as she swung her\\r\\nhat with its symbolic colors above her shining head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the picture that three of us carried to the front.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left him--all his errors redeemed by a noble death--with his face\\r\\nturned up to the stars, as silent, as mysterious as they, after our\\r\\nfirst battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the horrors of that night we two came away bound by an oath to\\r\\ncare for that child.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain my memory shifted to the days that found her a woman. Fair,\\r\\nbeautiful, dainty, her father\\'s daughter in looks, but inheriting from\\r\\na rare mother a peculiar strength of character, a moral force rarely\\r\\nfound with such a temperament and such beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had aided to raise her as became the child of her father, whose\\r\\nstory she knew as soon as she was able to understand, but she knew it\\r\\nfrom the lips of the brave mother, who cherished his memory. Until she\\r\\nwas a woman grown it was I, however, who, of her two self-appointed\\r\\nguardians, had watched over her. Children did not interest him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had married some years before that time, married well with an eye\\r\\nto a calm comfortable future, as became an artist who could not be\\r\\nhampered by the need of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, it was not until he knew that I was to marry her that he\\r\\nreally looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I, with all my experience of him, simply because I was never able\\r\\nto understand the dual nature, failed at that fatal hour when we stood\\r\\ntogether beside our protegee to apply to the situation the knowledge\\r\\nthat years of experience should have taught me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so bound up in my own feelings that I failed to remember that,\\r\\nuntil then, I had never had a great emotion that his nature had not\\r\\nacted as a lens in the kindling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, too, there was a dense sense of the conventional--a logical\\r\\nenough birthright--in my make-up. I, who had known him so long, so\\r\\nwell, seemed, nevertheless, when he married, to have fancied there was\\r\\nsome hocus-pocus in the ceremony, which should make a definite change\\r\\nin a man\\'s character, as well as a presumable change in his way of\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must have been that there, in the open, at the foot of the knoll, I\\r\\nslept, as one does the first night after a long awaited death, when\\r\\nthe relief that pain is passed, and suspense ended, deadens grief.\\r\\nShe was no longer in this world of torture. That helped me.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next I knew, it was the sun, and not the moon which was shining on\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind had stilled its sobbing in the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the rushing of the river sounded in my ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose slowly, and mounted the steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tiny white marble mosque of wonderful beauty--for he who erected it\\r\\nwas one of the world\\'s great artists, whose works will live to glorify\\r\\nhis name and his art when all his follies shall have been\\r\\nforgotten--stood in a court paved with marble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was encircled with a low coping of the whitest of stone. Over this\\r\\nlow wall vines were already growing, and the woodbine that was mingled\\r\\nwith it was stained with those glorious tints in which Nature says to\\r\\nlife, \"Even death is beautiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wide bronze doors on either side were open.\\r\\n\\r\\nI accepted the fact without even wondering why--or asking myself who,\\r\\nin opening them, had discovered my presence!\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a brief time I stood once more within the room where she lay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn awful peace fell on my soul, as if her soul had whispered in the\\r\\nwords we had so often read together:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I lie so composedly\\r\\n     Now in my bed--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew at last, as I gazed, that all her life, and all mine, as well,\\r\\nhad been to his profit. That out of this, too, he had wrought some of\\r\\nhis greatness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interior of the vault was of red marble, and, such of chiselling\\r\\nas there was done, seemed wonderful to me even in my frame of mind. I\\r\\ntook it all in, through unwilling, though fascinated eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen it since. I can never forget it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet art is, and always has been, so much to me, that I could not help,\\r\\neven in my strangely wrought-up mental condition, comprehending and\\r\\nadmiring his scheme and the masterly manner in which he had worked it\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my feet, as I stood on the threshold, was an elaborate scroll\\r\\nengraved on the stone and surrounded with a wreath of leaves, that\\r\\nvied with the tombs of the old world. As I gazed at it, and read the\\r\\ngothic letters in which it was set forth that this monument was\\r\\nerected in adoration of this woman, how well I remembered the day when\\r\\nwe had crouched together over those stones in the crypt at Certosa, to\\r\\nadmire the chiselling of Donatello which had inspired this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a space left for the signature of the artist, which would, I\\r\\nknew, some day be written there boldly enough!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the centre stood the sarcophagus.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt its presence, though my eyes avoided it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove, on the wall, were the words borne along by carved angels:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"My love she sleeps: Oh, may her sleep\\r\\n    As it was lasting, so be deep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I seemed to hear her voice intone the words as I had heard them\\r\\nfrom her lips so many times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then my eyes fell--on her! Aye! On her, stretched at full length\\r\\nin her warm and glorious tomb. For above her mortal remains slept her\\r\\neffigy wrought with all the skill of a great art.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had feared to look upon it, but having looked, I felt that I could\\r\\nnever tear myself away from its peace and loveliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long folds of the drapery fell straight from the small, round\\r\\nthroat to the tiny unshod feet, and so wonderfully was it wrought,\\r\\nthat it seemed as if the living beautiful flesh of the slender body\\r\\nwas still quick beneath it. The exquisite hands that I knew so\\r\\nwell--so delicate, and yet so strong--were gently crossed upon her\\r\\nbreast, and her arms held a long stemmed lily, emblem of purity, and\\r\\nit looked to me there like a martyr\\'s palm.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was the pale reflection from the red walls, but the figure\\r\\nseemed too real to be mere stone!\\r\\n\\r\\nI forgot the irony of the fact that I was merely seeing her through\\r\\nhis eyes--the eyes of the man who had robbed me. I felt only her\\r\\npresence. I fell on my knees. I flung my arms across the beautiful\\r\\nform--no colder to my embrace than had been the living woman! As I\\r\\nrecoiled from the death-like touch, my eyes fell on the words carved\\r\\non the face of the sarcophagus, and once more, it was like the voice\\r\\nthat was hushed in my ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"I pray to God that she may lie\\r\\n    Forever with unopened eye\\r\\n    While the dim sheeted ghosts go by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Amen,\" I said, with all my heart, to the words he had carved above\\r\\nher, for what, after the fever of such a life, could be so welcome to\\r\\nher as dreamless, eternal silence, in which there would be no more\\r\\npassion, no more struggling, no more love?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, if I wished with all my soul, that the great surprise of death\\r\\nmight, for her, have been peace and silence, did I not bar myself as\\r\\nwell as him from the hope of Heaven?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long I stood there, with hungry eyes devouring the marble effigy\\r\\nof her I so loved--now tortured by its fidelity, now punished by its\\r\\ncoldness--I never knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I noticed the changing of the light, the shifting of the\\r\\nshadows, as the sun swung steadily upward, but it was a subconscious\\r\\nobservation which did not recall me to myself and the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack, back turned my thoughts to the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, where she now lay in her gorgeous tomb, had then stood an arbor,\\r\\nand below had roared the rushing river.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the night of our wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as now, on this very spot, I had looked down on that fair pale\\r\\nface, and then it had given me back a gaze as lifeless as this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had missed my bride from the little throng in the quaint house\\r\\nbeyond. I had stolen out to seek her. Instinctively I had turned to\\r\\nthe old arbor above the river, where her hours of meditation had\\r\\nalways been passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was there I had found her as a child, when I came to bring her\\r\\nfather\\'s dying message. It was there I had asked her to become my\\r\\nwife. It was there we three had first stood together.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a week before the wedding she had been in a strange mood,\\r\\ntearless, but nervous, and sad! Still, it had not seemed to me an\\r\\nunnatural mood in such a woman, on the eve of her marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nFate is ironical.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remembered that I was serenely happy as I sped up the hill in search\\r\\nof her, and so sure that I knew where to find her. Light scudding\\r\\nclouds crossed the track of the moon, which, with a broadly smiling\\r\\nface, rolled up the heavens at a spinning pace, now appearing, now\\r\\ndisappearing behind the flying clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was humming gaily as I strode along the narrow path. Nothing tugged\\r\\nat my heart strings to warn me of approaching sorrow. There was no\\r\\nsignal in all nature to prepare me for the end in a complete shipwreck\\r\\nof all my dreams. The peace about me gave no hint of its cynicism.\\r\\nNothing, either within or without, hinted that my hours of happiness\\r\\nand content were running out rapidly to the last sand!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had reached the shallow steps that led up the knoll to the arbor!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the clouds were swept off from the face of the moon,\\r\\nand the white light fell full on her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was not alone. She rested in the arms of my friend, as, God\\r\\nhelp me, she had never rested in mine--in an abandon that was only too\\r\\neloquent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was said?\\r\\n\\r\\nWho but God knows that now?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do men like us, who have thought themselves one in all things,\\r\\nuntil one love rends them asunder, say at such a time? As for me, I\\r\\ncannot recall a word!\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not even see his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think he saw mine no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe seemed to see into the soul of each other, through the very heart\\r\\nof that frail woman between us, that slender creature in the bridal\\r\\ndress, who sank down before us, as if the colliding passions of two\\r\\nstrong men had killed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was he who raised her up. His hands placed her in my arms. No need\\r\\nto say that she was blameless. I knew all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only Fate after all, that I blamed, yet the fatalist is human.\\r\\nHe suffers in living like other men--sometimes more, because he\\r\\nrefuses to struggle in the clutches of Chance!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I gazed down into her white face, I heard the steps of my friend,\\r\\neven above the roaring of the river, as he strode down the hillside,\\r\\nout of my life! And I know not even to-day which was the bitterest\\r\\ngrief, the loss of my faith in being loved, or the passing from my\\r\\nheart of that man!\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the pain of the night that followed, only the silence and our own\\r\\nhearts knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove and passion are so twinned in some hours of life that one cannot\\r\\ndistinguish in himself the one from the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto my keeping \"to have and to hold,\" the law had given this\\r\\nbeautiful woman, \"until death should us part.\" I loved her! But, out\\r\\nof her heart, at once stronger and weaker than mine, my friend had\\r\\nbarred me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not in hours like these, that all men can be sane.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of what might have been, if they had not met that night, and\\r\\nmy ignoble side craved ignorance of that Chance, or the brutality to\\r\\nignore it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked down into that cold face as I laid her from the arms that had\\r\\nborne her down the hill--laid her on what was to have been her nuptial\\r\\ncouch--and closed the door between us and all the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were together--alone--at last!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had dreamed of this hour. Here was its realization. I watched the\\r\\nmisery of remembrance dawn slowly on her white face. I pitied her as I\\r\\ngazed at her, yet my whole being cried out in rage at its own pity. On\\r\\nher trembling lips I seemed to see his kisses. In her frightened eyes\\r\\nI saw his image. The shudder that shook her whole body as her eyes\\r\\nheld mine, confessed him--and that confession kept me at bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that night I sat beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat mad words I uttered a merciful nature never let me recall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the chill dawn I fled from her presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe width of the world had lain between us, me--and this woman whom I\\r\\nhad worshipped, of whom a consuming jealousy had made ten years of my\\r\\nlife a mad fever, which only her death had cured. Saner men have\\r\\nprotested against the same situation that ruined me--and yet, even in\\r\\nmy reasoning moments, like this, I knew that to have rebelled would\\r\\nhave been to have forced a tragic climax before the hour at which Fate\\r\\nhad fixed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen something--I know not what--recalled me again to the present, I\\r\\nfound that I had sat by her a day, as, on our last meeting, I watched\\r\\nout the night. The sun, which had sent its almost level rays in at the\\r\\neast door of the tomb when I entered, was now shining in brilliant\\r\\nalmost level rays in at the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was passing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shadow fell from the opposite door. I became suddenly conscious of\\r\\nhis presence, and, once more, across her body, I looked into my\\r\\nfriend\\'s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween us, as on that dreadful night, she was stretched!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was at peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur colliding emotions might rend us, they could never again tear at\\r\\nher gentle heart. That was at rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver her we stood once more, as if years had not passed--years of\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove the woman we had both loved, we two, who had stood shoulder to\\r\\nshoulder in battle, been one in thought and ambition until passion\\r\\nrent us asunder, met as we parted, but she was at peace!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had severed without farewells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met without greetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood in silence until he waved me to a broad seat behind me, and\\r\\nsank into a similar niche opposite.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in the shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lay between us in the level light of the setting sun, which fell\\r\\nacross her from the wide portal, and once more our eyes met on her\\r\\nface, but they would not disturb her calm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis influence was once more upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the silence--for it was some time before he spoke, and I was\\r\\ndumb--my accursed eye for detail had taken in the change in him. Yet I\\r\\nfancied I was not looking at him. I noted that he had aged--that this\\r\\nwas one of the periods in him which I knew so well--when a passion\\r\\nfor work was on him, and the fever and fervor of creation trained him\\r\\ndown like a race-horse, all spirit and force. I noted that he still\\r\\nwore the velveteens and the broad hat and loose open collar of his\\r\\nstudent days.\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting on either side of the tomb he had built to enshrine her, on\\r\\ncarved marble seats such as Tuscan poets sat on, in the old days, to\\r\\nsing to fair women, with our gaze focussed on the long white form\\r\\nbetween us--ah, between us indeed!--his voice broke the long silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, and the broad brim of his\\r\\nsoft hat swept the marble floor with a gentle rhythmic swish, as it\\r\\nswung idly from his loosened grasp. I heard it as an accompaniment to\\r\\nhis voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes never once strayed from her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think you are to be pitied,\" he said. \"You are wrong! No one who\\r\\nhas not sinned against another needs pity. I meant you no harm.\\r\\nFate--my temperament, your immobility, the very gifts that have made\\r\\nme what I am were to blame--if blame there were. Every one of us must\\r\\nlive out his life, according to his nature. I, as well as you!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When, on this very spot where we last parted, you told me that you\\r\\nloved her, I swear to you, if need be, that I rejoiced. I was glad\\r\\nthat she would have you to make the future smooth for her. Later I\\r\\ngrew to envy you. It was for your safety, as well as mine and hers,\\r\\nthat I decided to see neither of you again until she had been some\\r\\ntime your wife. No word of love, no confidence of any kind, had ever\\r\\npassed between us. When I wrote you that I should not be here to see\\r\\nyou married, and when not even your reproaches could move me, I had\\r\\nalready engaged my passage on a sailing ship bound for the Azores. I\\r\\nhad planned to put a long uncertain voyage between you and any\\r\\npossibility that I might mar your chances for happiness, for the\\r\\nnearer the day came, the more--in spite of myself--I resented it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good intentions were thwarted by--Fate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For some reason, forgotten and unimportant, the Captain deferred\\r\\nlifting anchor for a whole week. I called myself unpretty names for\\r\\nthinking that I could not even see her without danger. I despised\\r\\nmyself for the judgment that accused me of being such a scamp as to\\r\\nthink I would do anything to rob her of the protection and safety you\\r\\ncould give her, and I could not, and an egoist for being possessed\\r\\nwith the idea that I could if I would.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suddenly I felt quite sure of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet I had meant to see her without being seen, when I hurried so\\r\\nunexpectedly down here on your wedding night. I fancied I only longed\\r\\nto see what a lovely bride she would make--she who as a child, a girl,\\r\\na maiden, had been in your eyes the most exquisite creature you had\\r\\never known; she whom I had avoided for years, because I, of all men,\\r\\ncould least afford to take a place in her life! I longed to see those\\r\\neyes, still so pure, under her bridal veil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I came in secret! I saw her--and all prudence fled out of me, leaving\\r\\nbut one instinct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was it my fault that, alone, she fled from the house? That, with her\\r\\nveil thrown over her arm, she ran directly by me, like a sprite in the\\r\\nmoonlight, to this spot?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rest you know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not you who need pity!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have the pain of an imperishable loyalty in your soul. It is like\\r\\na glory in your face, in spite of all you have suffered. As I look at\\r\\nyou, it seems but yesterday that all was well between us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I lost much in losing you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor am I sure that you were right to go! But that was for your own\\r\\nnature to decide. In your place I should have fought Fate, I expected\\r\\nyou to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I loved her first, because she satisfied my eyes. I loved her the\\r\\nmore that she was denied to me! Yet I knew always that this love was\\r\\nnot in me what it was in you. With me it was, like many other emotions\\r\\nof a similar sort--a sentiment that would pass. I tried to think\\r\\notherwise. But I had awakened her heart, and you, to whom the law had\\r\\ngiven her, were gone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I waited long for your return, or for some sign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You neither came nor spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I argued that something must be done. I owed it to her to offer her\\r\\nmy protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I came back here. I met her on this very spot. I said to her, \\'You\\r\\nare alone in the world--your mother has married--she has other\\r\\nchildren. I have saddened your life with my love. Let me at least help\\r\\nto cheer it again. You need affection. Here it is--in my arms!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, while I waited for her answer, I prayed with all my soul that\\r\\nshe might deny me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless her! She did! I turned away from her with a glad heart, and\\r\\nin that heart I enshrined this woman, who, loving me, had denied me.\\r\\nThere I set up her image, pure and inviolate. Two long years I stayed\\r\\naway from her, and as I worked, I worshipped her, and out of that\\r\\nworship I wrought a great thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With time, however, her real image grew faint within me. Other\\r\\nemotions, other experiences seemed to blur and dim it. In spite of\\r\\nmyself, I returned here. Once more I stood on this spot, within the\\r\\ngaze of her deep eyes. I began to believe that a love everlasting, all\\r\\nenduring, had been given me! But still it was passion that pleaded for\\r\\npossession, and still it was self-knowledge that looked on in fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Passion bade me plead: \\'You love me! You need me! Come to me!\\' And\\r\\nfear kept my heart still, in dread of her consent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she looked up into my face with eyes that seemed to widen under\\r\\nmine, and simply whispered, \\'My mother.\\' The heart that knew and\\r\\nunderstood now all that sad history seemed to feel that her act might\\r\\nre-open the mother\\'s old wound; that the verdict \\'like mother, like\\r\\ndaughter\\' would turn virtue back to sin again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once more I went out into the world with a light heart! Her virtue,\\r\\nher strength, seemed to be mine. I went back to my work with renewed\\r\\nspirit, back to my life with no new self-reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But once more I swung round the circle. With a perversity that,\\r\\ndreading success, and conscious of fear, yet longs to strive for what\\r\\nit dreads to win, I returned to her again. The death of her mother was\\r\\nmy new excuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She came to me--here, as usual. But this time she came leading by the\\r\\nhand her little sister, and I felt her armored against me even before\\r\\nI spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who used to believe in a merciful God, can you explain to me why\\r\\nhe has left in the nature of man, created--so you believe--in His own\\r\\nimage--that impulse to destroy that which he loves? I loved her for\\r\\nexactly what she was. I loved her because she had the courage to\\r\\nresist me. Yet from each denial so ardently desired, so thankfully\\r\\nreceived, my soul sprang up strengthened in desire. Safe above me I\\r\\nworshipped her. Once in my arms, I knew, only too well, that even that\\r\\nlove would pass as all other emotions had done. I knew I should put\\r\\nher aside, gently if I could, urgently, if I must, and pass on. That\\r\\nis my Fate! Everything that enters my life leaves something I\\r\\nneed--and departs! For what I have not, I hunger. What I win soon\\r\\nwearies me. It is the price life exacts for what it gives me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, when August of this year came round, I found myself once more\\r\\nstanding here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten years had passed since we stood here with her between us--ten\\r\\nyears that had laid their richest gifts on her beauty. This time she\\r\\nwas indeed alone. As I looked into her face, I somehow thought of\\r\\nAgamemnon\\'s fair daughter doomed to die a virgin. You can see my\\r\\n\\'Iphigenia\\' in the spring, if you chance to be in Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This time, self-knowledge deserted me. The past was forgotten. The\\r\\nfuture was undreaded. The passion in my heart spoke without reserve\\r\\nor caution! I no longer said: \\'You need me! You love me!\\' I cried out:\\r\\n\\'I can no longer live without you!\\' I no longer said, \\'Come to me!\\' I\\r\\npleaded, \\'Take me to your heart. There, where my image is, let me rest\\r\\nat last. I have waited long, be kind to me.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw her sway toward me as once before she had done. It was too late\\r\\nto look backward or forward. I had conquered. In my weakness I\\r\\nbelieved it was thus ordained--that I deserved some credit for waiting\\r\\nso long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet, when she left me here alone, having promised, with downcast eyes\\r\\nthat avoided mine, to place her hand in mine, and walk boldly beside\\r\\nme down the forbidden path of the world, I fell down on the spot her\\r\\nfeet had pressed, and wept bitterly, as I had never done before in all\\r\\nmy life. Wept over the shattered ideal, the faith I had so wilfully\\r\\ntorn down, the miserable victory of my meanest self.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought the end was come. Fate was merciful to me, however!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had myself fixed the following Thursday as the day for our\\r\\ndeparture. As I dated a letter to her that night my mind\\r\\ninvoluntarily reckoned the days, and I was startled to find that\\r\\nThursday fell on that fatal tenth of August.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought I could be so tortured in my mind as I was by the\\r\\ndread that she should notice the dire coincidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The hour that should have brought her to me, brought a note instead.\\r\\nIt was dated boldly \\'August tenth.\\' It was without beginning or\\r\\nsignature. It said--I can repeat every word--\\'Of the two roads to\\r\\nself-destruction open to me, I have chosen the one that will, in the\\r\\nend, give the least pain to you. I love you. I have always loved you\\r\\nsince I was a child. I do not regret anything yet! Thank God for me\\r\\nthat I depart without ever having seen a look of weariness in the eyes\\r\\nthat gazed so lovingly into mine when we parted, and thank Him for\\r\\nyourself that you will never see a look of reproach in mine. I know no\\r\\ntime so fitting to say a long farewell for both of us as\\r\\nthis--Farewell, then.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew what I should find when I went up the hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The doctors said \\'heart disease.\\' She had been troubled with some\\r\\nsuch weakness. I alone knew the truth! As I had known myself, she had\\r\\nknown me!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think you suffer--you, who might, but for me, have made her\\r\\nhappy, as such women should be, in a world of simple natural joys! My\\r\\nfriend, loss without guilt is pain--but it is not without the balm of\\r\\nvirtuous compensation. You have at least a right to grieve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I! I am forced to know myself. To feel myself borne along in\\r\\nspite of myself; and to realize that she who should have worn a crown\\r\\nof happy womanhood, lies there a sacrifice, to be bewailed like\\r\\nJepthah\\'s one fair daughter; and to sit here in full dread of the\\r\\nebbing of even this great emotion, knowing too well that it will pass\\r\\nout of my life when it shall have achieved its purpose, leaving only\\r\\nas evidence _this_--another great work, crystalized into immortality\\r\\nin everlasting stone. I know that I cannot long hold it here in my\\r\\nheart. The day will come--perhaps soon--when I shall stand outside\\r\\nthat door, and recognize this as my work, and be proud of it, without\\r\\nthe power to grieve, as I do now; when I shall approve my own\\r\\nhandiwork, and be unable to mourn for her who was sacrificed to\\r\\nachieve it. What is your pain to mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I saw the hot tears drop from his eyes. I saw them fall on the\\r\\nmarble floor, and they watered the very spot where his name was so\\r\\nsoon to spring up in pride to confess his handiwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked on her calm face. I knew she did not regret her part! I rose,\\r\\nand, without a word, I passed out at the wide door, and, without\\r\\nlooking back, I passed down the slope in the dusk, and left them\\r\\ntogether--the woman I had loved, and the friend I had lost!\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his voice died away, he sat upright quickly, threw a glance about\\r\\nthe circle, and, with another fine gesture said: \"_Et voila_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor was the only one to really laugh, though a broad grin ran\\r\\nround the circle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" remarked the Doctor, who had been leaning against a tree, and\\r\\nindulging in shrugs and an occasional groan, which had not even\\r\\ndisconcerted the story teller, \"I suppose that is how that very great\\r\\nman, your governor, did the trick. I can see him in every word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all you know about it,\" laughed the Sculptor. \"That is not a\\r\\nbit how the governor did it. That is how I should have done it, had I\\r\\nbeen the governor, and had the old man\\'s chances. I call that an ideal\\r\\nthing to happen to a man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not even founded on fact--which might have been some excuse for\\r\\ntelling it,\" groaned the Critic. \"I\\'d love to write a review of that\\r\\nstory. I\\'d polish it off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you would,\" sneered the Sculptor. \"That\\'s all a critic is\\r\\nfor--to polish off the tales he can\\'t write. I call that a nice\\r\\nromantic, ideal tale for a sculptor to conceive, and as the Doctor\\r\\nsaid the other night, it is a possible story, since I conceived it,\\r\\nand what the mind of mortal can conceive, can happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The trouble,\" said the Journalist, \"with chaps like you, and the\\r\\nCritic, is that your people are all framework. They\\'re not a bit of\\r\\nflesh and blood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d like to know,\" said the Sculptor, throwing himself back in his\\r\\nchair, \"who has a right to decide that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I\\'d like to know,\" said the Youngster, \"is, what did she do\\r\\nbetween times? Of course he sculpted, and earned slathers of money.\\r\\nBut she--?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ouch--help!\" cried the Sculptor. \"Do I know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly!\" answered the Critic, \"and that you don\\'t sticks out in\\r\\nevery line of your story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goodness me, you might ask the same thing about Leda, or Helen of\\r\\nTroy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the Doctor. \"But we know what they did!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot you do. It is because they are old classics, and you accept\\r\\nthem, whereas my story is quite new and original--and you were\\r\\nunprepared for it, and so you can\\'t appreciate it. Anyway, it\\'s my\\r\\nfirst-born story, and I\\'ll defend it with my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a laugh replied to the challenge, and the attitude of defense he\\r\\nstruck, as he leaped to his feet, though the Journalist said, under\\r\\nhis breath, \"It takes a carver in stone to think of a tale like that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But think,\" replied the Doctor, \"how much trouble some women would\\r\\nescape if they kept on saying A B C like that--for the A B C is\\r\\nusually lovely--and when it was time to X Y Z--often terrible, they\\r\\njust slipped out through the \\'open door.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the other hand, they _risk_ losing heaps of fun,\" said the\\r\\nJournalist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I like about that story,\" said the Lawyer, \"is that it is so\\r\\naristocratic. Every one seems to have plenty of money. They all three\\r\\ndo just what they like, have no duties but to analyze themselves, and\\r\\nevidently everything goes like clockwork. The husband enjoys being\\r\\nmorbid, and has the means to be gloriously so. The sculptor likes to\\r\\ncarve Edgar Allan Poe all over the place, and the fair lady is able to\\r\\ngratify the tastes of both men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can laugh as much as you please,\" sighed the Sculptor, \"I wish it\\r\\nhad happened to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"you have the privilege of going to bed and\\r\\ndreaming that it did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" answered the Sculptor. \"That is just what I am going to\\r\\ndo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did I tell you last night?\" said the Doctor, under his breath,\\r\\nas he watched the Sculptor going slowly toward the house. \"Bet he has\\r\\nbeen telling that tale to himself under many skies for years!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" laughed the Journalist, \"that the only reason he has\\r\\nnever built the tomb is that he has never had the money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, be fair!\" said the Violinist. \"He has not built the tomb because\\r\\nhe is not his father. The old man would have done it in a minute, only\\r\\nhe lacked imagination. You bet he never day-dreamed, and yet what\\r\\nskill he had, and what adventures! He never saw anything but the facts\\r\\nof life, yet how magnificently he recorded them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a pity,\" sighed the Violinist, \"that the son did not seek a\\r\\ndifferent career.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What difference does it make after all?\" remarked the Doctor. \"One\\r\\nnever knows when the next generation will step up or down, and, after\\r\\nall, what does it matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all very well for you to talk,\" said the Critic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you that the great pageant would have been just as\\r\\ninteresting from any other point of view. It has been a great\\r\\nspectacle,--this living. I\\'m glad I\\'ve seen it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Amen to that,\" said the Divorcee. \"I only hope I am going to see it\\r\\nagain--even though it hurts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DIVORCEE\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nONE WOMAN\\'S PHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A MODERN WIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I look back, I remember that the next night was one of the most\\r\\ntrying of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we came down to dinner we all had visions of the destruction of\\r\\nLouvain, and the burning of the famous library. It is hard enough to\\r\\nthink of lives going out; still, as the Doctor was so fond of saying,\\r\\n\"man is born to die, and woman, too,\" but that the great works of men,\\r\\nhis bequest to the coming generations, should be wantonly destroyed,\\r\\nseemed even more horrible, especially to those who love beauty, and\\r\\nthe idea of the charred leaves of the library flying in the air above\\r\\nthe historic city of catholic culture, made us all feel as if we were\\r\\nsitting down to a funeral service rather than a very good dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatters were not made any gayer because Angele, who was waiting on\\r\\ntable, had rings round her eyes, which told of sleepless nights. And\\r\\nwhy? We were mere spectators. We had been interested to dispute and\\r\\nlook on. But she knew that somewhere out there in the northeast her\\r\\nman was carrying a gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet all about us the country was so lovely and so tranquil, horses\\r\\nwere walking the fields, and, even as we sat at dinner, we could hear\\r\\nthe voices and the heavy feet of the peasant women as they went home\\r\\nfrom their work. The garden had never been more beautiful than it was\\r\\nthat evening, with the silver light of the moon through the trees, and\\r\\nthe smell of the freshly watered earth and flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had no doubt who was to contribute the story. The Divorcee was\\r\\ndressed with unusual care for the role, and carried a big lace bag on\\r\\nher arm, and, as she leaned back in her chair, she pulled one of the\\r\\nbig old fashioned candles in its deep glass toward her, and said with\\r\\na nervous laugh:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall have to ask you to let me read my story. You know I am not\\r\\naccustomed to this sort of thing. It is really my very \\'first\\r\\nappearance,\\' and I could not possibly tell it as the rest of you more\\r\\nexperienced people can do,\" and she took the manuscript out of her\\r\\nlace bag, and, settling herself gracefully, unrolled it. The Youngster\\r\\nput a stool under her pretty feet, and the Doctor set a cushion behind\\r\\nher back, while the Journalist, with a laugh, poured her a glass of\\r\\nwater, and the Violinist ceremoniously leaned over, and asked, \"Shall\\r\\nI turn for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not help laughing, but it did not make her any the less\\r\\nnervous, or her voice any the less shaky as she began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was after dinner on one of those rare occasions when they dined\\r\\nalone together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were taking coffee in Mrs. Shattuck\\'s especial corner of the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and she had just asked her husband to smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was leaning back comfortably in a nest of cushions, in her very\\r\\nlatest gown, with a most becoming light falling on her from the tall,\\r\\nyellow-shaded lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was facing her--astride his chair, in a position man has loved\\r\\nsince creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was just thinking that his wife had never looked handsomer, finer,\\r\\nin fact, in all her life--quite the satisfactory, all-round,\\r\\ndesirable sort of a woman a man\\'s wife ought to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wondering if he would ever be any less attractive to all women\\r\\nthan he was now at forty-two--or any better able to resist his own\\r\\npower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she put her coffee cup back on the tiny table at her elbow, he\\r\\nleaned forward, and picked up a book which lay open on a chair near\\r\\nhim, and carelessly glanced at it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Schopenhauer,\" and he wrinkled his brows and glanced half whimsically\\r\\ndown the page. \"I never can get used to a woman reading that\\r\\nstuff--and in French, at that. If you took it up to perfect your\\r\\nGerman there would be some sense in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Shattuck did not reply. When a moment later, she did speak it was\\r\\nto ignore his remark utterly, and ask:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The _Kaiser Wilhelm_ got off in good season this morning--speaking of\\r\\nGerman things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" was the indifferent reply, \"at ten o\\'clock, quite\\r\\npromptly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose she was comfortable, and that you explained why I could not\\r\\ncome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly. One of your beastly head-aches. She understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck yawned lazily, and changed the subject, which did not seem to\\r\\ninterest him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say,\" he asked, still turning the leaves of the book\\r\\nhe held, \"that this pleases you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, amuses you? Instructs you, if you like that better?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I mean to say simply--since you insist--that he speaks the truth,\\r\\nand there are some--even among women--who must know the truth and\\r\\nabide by it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, thank Heaven,\" said the man, pulling at his cigar, \"that most\\r\\nwomen are more emotional than intelligent--as Nature meant them to\\r\\nbe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Shattuck examined her daintily polished nails, rubbed them\\r\\ncarefully on the palm of her hand, as women have a trick of doing, and\\r\\nthen polished them on her lace handkerchief, before she said, \"Yes, it\\r\\nis a pity that we are not all like that,--a very great pity--for our\\r\\nown sakes. Yet, unluckily, some of us _will_ think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the thinking woman is so rarely logical, so unable to take life\\r\\nimpersonally, that Schopenhauer does her no good. He only fills her\\r\\nmind with errors, mistrust, unhappiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You men always argue that way with women--as if life were not the\\r\\nsame for us as for you. Pass me the book. I wager that I can open it\\r\\nat random, and that you cannot deny the truth of the first sentence I\\r\\nread.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed her the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took it, laid it open carelessly on her knees, bending the covers\\r\\nfar back that it might stay open, and she gave her finger tips a final\\r\\nrub with her handkerchief before she looked at the page. She paused a\\r\\nbit after she glanced at it, then picked up the book and read:\\r\\n\"\\'_L\\'homme est par Nature porte a l\\'inconstance dans l\\'amour, la femme\\r\\na la fidelite. L\\'amour de l\\'homme baisse d\\'une facon sensible a partir\\r\\nde l\\'instant ou il a obtenu satisfaction: il semble que toute autre\\r\\nfemme ait plus d\\'attrait que celle qu\\'il possede._\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laid the book down, but she did not look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rubbish,\" was his remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I know. You men always find it so easy to say \\'rubbish\\' to all\\r\\nnatural truths which you prefer not to discuss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear Naomi, it seems to me that if you are to advocate\\r\\nSchopenhauer, you must go the whole length with him. The fault is in\\r\\nNature, and you must accept it as inevitable, and not kick against\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t kick against Nature--as you put it--I kick against\\r\\ncivilization, which makes laws regardless of Nature, which\\r\\ndeliberately shuts its eyes to all natural truths in regard to the\\r\\nrelations of men to women,--and is therefore forced to continually\\r\\nwink to avoid confessing its folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Civilization seems to me to have done the best it could with a very\\r\\ndifficult problem. It has not actually allowed different codes of\\r\\nmorals to men and women, and it may have had to wink on that account.\\r\\nRight there, in your Schopenhauer, you have a primal reason, that is,\\r\\nif you chose to follow your philosopher to the extent of actually\\r\\nbelieving that Nature has deliberately, from the beginning, protected\\r\\nwomen against that sin of which so much is made, and to which she has,\\r\\nas deliberately, for economic reasons of her own, tempted men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do believe it, truly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are no more charitable toward my sex than most women are. Yet\\r\\nneither your teacher nor you may be right. A theoretic arguer like\\r\\nSchopenhauer makes good enough reading for calm minds, but he is bad\\r\\nfor an emotional temperament, and, by Jove, Naomi, he was a bad\\r\\nexample of his own philosophy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Dick, I am afraid I read Schopenhauer because I thought what\\r\\nhe writes long before I ever heard of him. I read him because did I\\r\\nnot find a clear logical mind going the same way my mind will go, I\\r\\nmight be troubled with doubts, and afraid that I was going quite\\r\\nwrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, the deuce and all with a woman when she begins to read stuff\\r\\nlike that is her inability to generalize. You women take everything\\r\\nhome to yourselves. You try to deduct conclusions from your own lives\\r\\nwhich men like Schopenhauer have scanned the centuries for. The\\r\\nnatural course of your life could hardly have provided you with the\\r\\npessimism with which--I hope you will pardon my remark, my dear--you\\r\\nhave treated me several times in the past few months. Chamfort and\\r\\nSchopenhauer did that. But these are not subjects a man discusses\\r\\neasily with his wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed? Then that is surely an error of civilization. If a man can\\r\\ndiscuss such matters more easily with a woman who is not his wife, it\\r\\nis because there is no frankness in marriage. Dick, did it ever occur\\r\\nto you that a man and woman, strongly attracted toward one another,\\r\\nmight live together many years without understanding each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God forbid!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How easily you say that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard that most women think they are not understood, but I\\r\\nnever reflected on the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You and I have not troubled one another much with our doubts and\\r\\nperplexities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You and I have been very happy together--I hope.\" There was a little\\r\\npause before the last two words, as if he had expected her to\\r\\nanticipate them with something, and there was a half interrogative\\r\\nnote in his voice. She made no response, so he went on, \"I\\'ve surely\\r\\nnot been a hard master--and I hope I\\'ve not been selfish. I know I\\'ve\\r\\nnot been unloving.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I hope you\\'ve not suffered many discomforts on my account. I\\r\\nthink, as women go, I am fairly reasonable--or I have been.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason Shattuck seemed to find the cigar he was smoking most\\r\\nunsatisfactory. Either it had been broken, or he had unconsciously\\r\\nchewed the end--a thing which he detested--and there was a pause while\\r\\nhe discarded the weed, and selected a fresh one. He appeared to be\\r\\nreflecting as he lighted it, and if his mind could have been read, it\\r\\nwould have probably been discovered that he was wondering how it had\\r\\nhappened that the conversation had taken this turn, and mentally\\r\\ncursing his own stupidity in making any remarks on the Schopenhauer.\\r\\nHe was conscious all the time that his wife was looking rather\\r\\nsteadily at him, and he knew that at least a conventional reply was\\r\\nexpected of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear girl,\" he said, \"I look back on ten very satisfactory years\\r\\nof married life. You have been a model wife, a charming companion--and\\r\\nif occasionally it has occurred to me--just lately--that my wife has\\r\\ndeveloped rather singular, to say the least, unflattering ideas of\\r\\nlife, why, you have such a brilliant way of putting it, that I am more\\r\\nthan half proud that you\\'ve the brains to hold such ideas, though\\r\\nthey are a bit disconcerting to me as a husband. I suppose the\\r\\ndevelopment is logical enough. You were always, even as a girl,\\r\\ninclined to making footnotes. I suppose their present daring is simply\\r\\nthe result of our being just a little older than we used to be. I\\r\\nsuppose if we did not outgrow our illusions, the road to death would\\r\\nbe too tragic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment she made no reply. Then, as if for the first time owning\\r\\nto the idea which had long been uppermost in her mind, she said\\r\\nsuddenly: \"The truth of the matter is, that I really believe marriage\\r\\nis foolish. I do believe that no man ever approached it without\\r\\nregretting that civilization had made it necessary, and that many men\\r\\nwould escape, at the very last moment, if women did not so rigidly\\r\\nhold them to their promises, and if, between two ridiculous positions,\\r\\nmarriage having been pushed nearest, had not become desperately\\r\\ninevitable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How absurd, Naomi, when you see the whole procession of men\\r\\nwalking,--according to their dispositions--calmly or eagerly to their\\r\\nfate every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nevertheless, I think the pre-nuptial confessions of a majority of\\r\\nmen of our class, would prove that what I say is true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you hinting that it was true in your case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck gave an amused laugh. \"Do you mean to say that you kept me to\\r\\nthe point?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not exactly. At that time I had an able bodied father who would have\\r\\nhad to be dealt with. Besides, a man does not own up even to\\r\\nhimself--not always--when he finds himself face to face with the\\r\\ninevitable. I am not speaking of what men talk about in such cases, or\\r\\nof what they do, but of what they feel,--of the fact that, in too many\\r\\ninstances, Nature not having meant men for bondage, after they have\\r\\npassed the Rubicon to that spot from which the code of civilized honor\\r\\ndoes not permit them to turn back, they usually have a period of\\r\\nregret, and are forced to make a real effort to face the Future,--to\\r\\ngo on, in fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smile had died out of Shattuck\\'s face and he said quite seriously:\\r\\n\"As far as we are concerned, Naomi, I have very different\\r\\nrecollections of the whole affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you? And yet, months before we were married, I knew that it\\r\\nwould not have broken your heart if the wedding had not come off at\\r\\nall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, the modern heart does not break easily in this age. We are\\r\\nschooled to meet the accidents of life with some philosophy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet to have lost you then, would have killed me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck looked at her sharply, with, one might almost have said, a\\r\\nnew interest, but she was no longer looking at him. She went on,\\r\\nhurriedly: \"You loved me, of course. I was of your world. I was a\\r\\nwoman that other men liked, and therefore a desirable woman. I was of\\r\\ngood family--altogether your social equal, in fact, quite the sort of\\r\\nwoman it became you to marry. I pleased you--and I loved you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" he said. \"In ten years, I doubt if you have ever\\r\\nmade so frank a declaration as that--in words.\" He was wondering, if,\\r\\nafter all, she were going to develop into an emotional woman, and his\\r\\nheart gave a quick leap at the very thought--for there are hours when\\r\\na woman who runs too much to head has a man at a cruel disadvantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Things are so much harder, so much more complex for a woman,\" she\\r\\nwent on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the protection of the community?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps. Still, it is not always pleasant to be a woman,--and yet\\r\\nthink; a woman whose reason has been mistakenly developed at the\\r\\nexpense of her capacity to enjoy being a woman, and who is forced at\\r\\nthe same time to encounter the laws of Nature, and pay at the same\\r\\ntime, the penalty of being a woman, and the penalty of knowledge. For,\\r\\njust so surely as we live, we must encounter love.--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might take it out,\" interrupted the husband, \"in feeling\\r\\nflattered that it takes so much to conquer such as you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So we might, but that, once conquered, neither man nor Nature has any\\r\\nfurther use for us, and regret, like art, is long. Not even you can\\r\\ndeny,\" she exclaimed, sitting up in some excitement, and letting her\\r\\ncushions fall in a mess all about her, \"that life is very unfair to\\r\\nwomen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t see that. Physically it is a little rough on you, but\\r\\nthere are compensations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never been able to discover them. Love itself is hard on a\\r\\nwoman. It seems to stir a man\\'s faculties healthily. They seem the\\r\\nstronger and more fit for it. It does not seem to uproot a man\\'s whole\\r\\nbeing. Does it serve women in that way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I bear witness that it makes some of you deucedly handsome. And I\\r\\nhave heard that it makes some of you--good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, as chastisement does. No, Life seems to have adjusted matters\\r\\nbetween men and women very badly, very unjustly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet, as this life is the only one we know we must adjust\\r\\nourselves to it as we find it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no. We had better have accepted the thing as Nature gave it to\\r\\nus. We came into this world like beasts--why aren\\'t we content to live\\r\\nlike beasts, and make no pretenses? Women would have nothing to expect\\r\\nthen, and there\\'d be no such thing as broken hearts. In spite of all\\r\\nthe polish of civilization, man is simply bent on conquest. Woman is\\r\\nonly one phase of the chase to him--a chase in which every active\\r\\nvirile man is occupied from his cradle to his grave. You are the\\r\\nconquerors. We are simply the conquered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck tried to make his voice light, as he said: \"Not always\\r\\nunhappy ones, I fancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose all men flatter themselves that way, and argue that\\r\\nprobably the Sabine women preferred their fate to no fate at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be bitter on so old and impersonal a topic, Naomi. It is the\\r\\nlaw of life that one must give, and one must take. That the emotions\\r\\ndiffer does not prove that one is better than the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck took a turn up and down the long room, not quite at ease with\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Shattuck seemed to be thinking. As he passed her, he stopped,\\r\\npicked up her cushions, and re-arranged them about her, with an idle\\r\\ncaress by the way, a kiss gently dropped on the inside of her white\\r\\nwrist.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed his every movement with a strange speculative look in her\\r\\neyes, almost as if he were some new and strange animal that she was\\r\\nstudying for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she spoke again, it was to go on as if she had not been\\r\\ninterrupted, \"It seems to me that man comes out of a great passion\\r\\njust as good as new, while a woman is shattered--in a moral\\r\\nsense--and never fully recovers herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck\\'s back was toward her when he replied. \"Sorry to spoil any\\r\\nmore illusions, dear child, but how about the long list of men who are\\r\\nannually ruined by it? The men in the prisons, the men who kill\\r\\nthemselves, the men who hang for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Those are crimes. I am not talking of the criminal classes, but of\\r\\nthe world in which normal people live.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our set,\" he laughed, \"but that is not the whole world, alas!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know that men--well bred, cultivated, refined, even honorable\\r\\nmen,--seem to be able to repeat every emotion of life. A woman scales\\r\\nthe heights but once. Hence it must depend, in the case of women\\r\\ncapable of deep love--on the men whether the relation into which\\r\\nmarriage betrays them be decent or indecent. What I should like to be\\r\\nable to discover is--what provision does either man or civilization\\r\\npropose to make for the woman whom Fate, in wanton irony, reduces,\\r\\neven in marriage, to the self-considered level of the girl in the\\r\\nstreet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was amazement--even a foreboding--on Shattuck\\'s face as he\\r\\npaused in his walk, and, for the first time speaking anxiously\\r\\nejaculated, \"I swear I don\\'t follow you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on as if she had not been interrupted, as if she had\\r\\nsomething to say which had to be said, as if she were reasoning it out\\r\\nfor herself: \"Take my case. I don\\'t claim that it is uncommon. I do\\r\\nclaim that I was not the woman for the situation. I was an only child.\\r\\nMy father\\'s marriage had not been happy. I was brought up by a\\r\\ndisappointed man on philosophy and pessimism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old sceptics, and modern scoffers. I remember it well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Before I was out of my teens, I had imbibed a mistrust for all\\r\\nemotions. Perhaps you did not know that? You may have thought, because\\r\\nthey were not all on the outside, that I had none. My poor father had\\r\\nhoped, with his teachings, to save me from future misery. He had\\r\\nprobably thought to spare me the commonplace sorrows of love. But he\\r\\ncould not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is one thing, my child, that the passing generation cannot do\\r\\nfor its heirs--live for them--luckily. Why, you might as well forbid a\\r\\nrose to blossom by word of mouth, as try to thwart nature in a\\r\\nbeautiful healthy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems to me that to bring up a woman as I was brought up only\\r\\nprepares her to take the distemper the quicker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not remember that of you. But I do know that no woman was ever\\r\\nwooed as hotly as you were--or ever--I swear it--more ardently\\r\\ndesired. No woman ever led a man the chase you led me. If ever in\\r\\nthose days you were as anxious for my love as you have said you were\\r\\nthis evening, no one would have guessed it, least of all I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reason had already taught me that mine was but the common fate of\\r\\nall women: that life was demanding of me the usual tribute to\\r\\nposterity: that the sweetness of the emotion was Nature\\'s trick to\\r\\nmake it endurable. But according to Nature\\'s eternal plan, my heart\\r\\ncould not listen to my head--it beat so loud when you were by, it\\r\\ncould not hear, perhaps. But there was something of my father\\'s\\r\\nphilosophy left in me, and when I was alone it would speak, and be\\r\\nheard, too. Even when I believed in you--because I wanted to--and half\\r\\nhoped that all my teaching was wrong, I made a bargain with myself. I\\r\\ntold myself, quite calmly, that I knew perfectly well all the\\r\\npossibilities of the future. That if I went forward with you, I went\\r\\nforward deliberately with open eyes, knowing what, logically, I might\\r\\nexpect to find in the future. Ignorance--that blissful comfort of so\\r\\nmany women,--was denied me. Still, the spell of Nature was upon me,\\r\\nand for a time I dreamed that a depth of passionate love like mine, a\\r\\nlife of loyal devotion might wrap one man round, and keep him\\r\\nsafe--might in fact, work a miracle--and make one polygamous man\\r\\nmonogamous. But, even while that hope was in my heart, reason rose up\\r\\nand mocked it, bidding me advance into the Future at my peril. I did\\r\\nit, but I made a bargain with myself, I agreed to abide the\\r\\nconsequences--and to abide them calmly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And during all those days when I supposed we were so near\\r\\ntogether--you showed me nothing of this that was in your heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Men and women know very rarely anything of the great struggles that\\r\\ngo on in the hearts of one another. Besides, I knew how easily you\\r\\nwould reply--naturally. We are all on the defensive in this life. It\\r\\nwas with things deeper than words that I was dealing--the things one\\r\\n_does_--not says. Even in the early days of our engagement I knew that\\r\\nI was not as essential to you as you were to me. Life held other\\r\\ninterests for you. Even the flattery of other women still had its\\r\\ncharm for you. Young as I was, I said to myself: \\'If you marry this\\r\\nman--with your eyes open--blame yourself, not him, if you suffer.\\' I\\r\\ndo believe that I have been able to do that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck was astride his chair again, his elbows on the back, his chin\\r\\nin his hands. He no longer responded. Words were dangerous. His lips\\r\\nwere pressed close together, and there was a long deep line between\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love for you absorbed every other emotion of my life. But I seemed\\r\\nto lack some of the qualities that aid to reconcile other wives to\\r\\nlife. I seemed to be without mother-love. My children were dear to me\\r\\nonly because they were yours. The maternal passion, which in so many\\r\\nwomen is the absorbing emotion of life, was denied me. My children\\r\\nwere to me merely the tribute to posterity which Life had demanded of\\r\\nme as the penalty of your love--nothing more. I must be singularly\\r\\nunfitted for marriage, because, when the hour came in which I felt\\r\\nthat I was no longer your wife, your children seemed no longer mine.\\r\\nThey merely represented the next generation--born of me. I know that\\r\\nthis is very shocking. I have become used to it,--and, it is the\\r\\ntruth. I have not blamed you, I could not--and be reasonable. No man\\r\\ncan be other than Nature plans or permits, but how I have pitied\\r\\nmyself! I have been through the tempest alone. In spite of reason,--in\\r\\nspite of philosophy--I have suffered from jealousy, from shame, from\\r\\nrage, from self contempt. But that is all past now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not raised her voice, which seemed as without feeling as it\\r\\nwas without emphasis. She carefully examined her handkerchief corner\\r\\nby corner, and he noticed for the first time how thin her hands had\\r\\nbecome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naturally,\" she went on in that colorless voice, \"my first impulse\\r\\nwas to be done with life. But I could not bring myself to that, much\\r\\nas I desired it. It would have left you such a wretched memory of me.\\r\\nYou could never have pardoned me the scandal--and I felt that I had\\r\\nat least the right to leave you a decent recollection of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck\\'s head fell forward on his arms.--The idea of denial or\\r\\nprotest did not occur to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady voice went monotonously on. \"I could not bear to humble you\\r\\nin the eyes of others even by forcing you to face a scandal. I could\\r\\nnot bear to humble you in your own eyes by letting you suspect that I\\r\\nknew the truth. I could not bring myself to disturb the outward\\r\\nrespectability of your life by interrupting its outward calm. To be\\r\\nabsolutely honest--though I had lost you, I could not bring myself to\\r\\ngive you up,--as I felt I must, if I let any one discover--most of all\\r\\nyou--what I knew. So, like a coward, I lived on, becoming gradually\\r\\naccustomed to the idea that my day was past, but knowing that the\\r\\nmoment I was forced to speak, I would be forced to move on out of your\\r\\nlife. Singularly enough, as I grew calm, I grew to respect this other\\r\\nwoman. I could not blame her for loving you. I ended by admiring her.\\r\\nI had known her so well--she was such a proud woman! I looked back at\\r\\nmy marriage and saw the affair as it really was. I had not _sold_\\r\\nmyself to you exactly--I had loved you too much to bargain in that\\r\\nway; nevertheless, the marriage had been a bargain. In exchange for\\r\\nyour promise to protect and provide for me,--to feed me, clothe me,\\r\\nshare your fortune with me, and give me your name, I had given you\\r\\nmyself,--openly sanctioned by the law, of course--I was too great a\\r\\ncoward to have done it otherwise, in spite of the fact that the law\\r\\ngives that same permission to almost any one who asks for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naomi,\" he groaned from his covered mouth, \"what ghastly philosophy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t that the marriage law? How much better am I after all than the\\r\\npoor girl in the street, who is forced to it by misery? To be sure, I\\r\\nbelieve there is some farcical phrase in the bargain about promising\\r\\nto love none other,--a bare-faced attempt to outwit Nature,--at which\\r\\nNature laughs. Yet this other woman, proud, high-minded, unselfish,\\r\\nhitherto above reproach, had given herself for love alone--with\\r\\neverything to lose and nothing to gain. I have come to doubt myself. I\\r\\nhave had my day. For years it was an enviable one. No woman can hope\\r\\nfor more. What right have I to stand in the way of another woman\\'s\\r\\nhappiness? A happiness no one can value better than I, who so long\\r\\nwore it in security. I bore my children in peace, with the divine\\r\\nconsolation of your devotion about me. What right have I to deny\\r\\nanother woman the same joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShattuck sprang to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s not true!\" he gasped. \"It\\'s not true!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman never even raised her eyes. She went on carefully inspecting\\r\\nthe filmy bit of lace in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It _is_ true,\" she replied. \"Never mind how I discovered it. I know\\r\\nit. That is why she has gone abroad alone. I did not speak until I had\\r\\nto. I am a coward, but not enough of one to bear the thought of her\\r\\nalone in a foreign country with mind and emotions clouded. I may be\\r\\ncowardly enough to wish that I had never found it out,--I am not\\r\\ncoward enough to keep silent any longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA torrent of words rushed to the man\\'s lips, but he was too wise to\\r\\nmake excuses. Yet there were excuses. Any fair-minded judge would have\\r\\nsaid so. But he knew better than to think that for one moment they\\r\\nwould be excuses in the mind of this woman. Besides, the first man\\'s\\r\\nexcuse for the first sin has never been viewed with much respect under\\r\\nthe modern civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt her slowly rise to her feet, and when he raised his head to\\r\\nlook at her--not yet fully realizing what had happened to him--all\\r\\nemotion seemed to have become so foreign to her face, that he felt as\\r\\nif she were already a stranger to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took a last look round the room. Her eyes seemed to devour every\\r\\ndetail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall find means to give you your freedom at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will actually leave me--go away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can we two remain together now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But your children?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your children, Dick--I have forgotten that I have any. I have had my\\r\\nlife. You have still yours to live.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe swept by him down the long room, everything in which was so\\r\\nclosely associated with her. Before she reached the door, he was\\r\\nthere--and his back against it. She stopped, but she did not look at\\r\\nhim. If she could have read the truth in his face, it would have told\\r\\nher that she had never been loved as she was at that moment. All that\\r\\nshe had been in her loyalty, her nobility, was so much a part of this\\r\\nman\\'s life. What, compared to that, were petty sins, or big ones? He\\r\\nsaw the past as a drowning man sees the panorama of his existence. Yet\\r\\nhe knew that everything he could say would be powerless to move her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was useless to remind her of their happy years together. They could\\r\\nnever be happy again with this between them. It would be equally\\r\\nuseless to tell her that this other woman had known, but too well,\\r\\nthat he would never desert his wife for her. Had he not betrayed her?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf what use to tell her how he had repented his folly, that he could\\r\\nnever understand it himself? There were the facts, and Nature, and his\\r\\nwife\\'s philosophy against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he had dared be gay the moment the steamer slid into the channel!\\r\\nWas that only this morning? It seemed to be in the last century.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe approached, and stretched her hand toward the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not move.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t stop me,\" she pleaded. \"Don\\'t make it any harder than it is.\\r\\nLet me take with me the consolation of a decent life together--a\\r\\ndecent life decently severed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made one last appeal--he opened his arms wide to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shrank back with a shudder, crying out that he should spare her\\r\\nher own contempt--that he should leave her the power to seek\\r\\npeace--and her voice had such a tone of terror, as she recoiled from\\r\\nhim, that he felt how powerless any protest would be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout looking at him she quickly opened the door and passed out.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Divorcee nervously rolled up her manuscript.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual laugh was not forthcoming. No one dared. Men can\\'t\\r\\nrough-house that kind of a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s silence the Critic spoke up. \"You were right to\\r\\n_read_ that story. It is not the sort of thing that lends itself to\\r\\nnarrating. Of course you might have acted it out, but you were wise\\r\\nnot to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t help it--got to say it,\" said the Journalist: \"What a horrid\\r\\nwoman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Divorcee looked at him in amazement. \"How can you say that?\" she\\r\\nexclaimed. \"I thought I had made her so reasonable. Just what all\\r\\nwomen ought to be, and what none of us are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank God for that,\" said the Journalist. \"I\\'d as lief live in a\\r\\nworld created and run by George Bernard Shaw as in one where women\\r\\nwere like that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come,\" interrupted the Doctor, who had been eyeing her profile\\r\\nwith a curious half amused expression, all through the reading: \"Don\\'t\\r\\nlet us get on that subject to-night. A story is a story. You have\\r\\nasked, and you have received. None of you seem to really like any\\r\\nstory but your own, and I must confess that among us, we are putting\\r\\nforth a strange baggage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary,\" said the Critic, \"I think we are doing pretty well\\r\\nfor a crowd of amateurs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not an amateur,\" laughed the Journalist, \"and yours was the\\r\\nworst yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deny it,\" said the Critic. \"Mine had real literary quality, and a\\r\\nvery dramatic climax.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well, if death is dramatic--perhaps. You are the only one up to\\r\\ndate who has killed his heroine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No story is finished until the heroine is dead,\" said the Journalist.\\r\\n\"This woman,--I\\'ll bet she had another romance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did she?\" asked the Critic of the Divorcee, who was still nervously\\r\\nrolling her manuscript in both hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know. How should I? And if I did I shouldn\\'t tell you. It\\r\\nisn\\'t a true story, of course.\" And she rose from her chair and walked\\r\\naway into the moonlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean to say,\" ejaculated the Violinist, who admired her\\r\\ntremendously, \"that she made that up in the imagination she carries\\r\\naround under that pretty fluffy hair? I\\'d rather that it were\\r\\ntrue--that she had picked it up somewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we began to prepare to go in, the Doctor looked down the path to\\r\\nwhere the Divorcee was still standing. After a moment\\'s hesitation he\\r\\ntook her lace scarf from the back of her chair, and strolled after\\r\\nher. The Sculptor shrugged his shoulders with such a droll expression\\r\\nthat we all had to smile. Then we went indoors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, as he joined her--she told me about it\\r\\nafterwards--\"was that the way it happened?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" replied the Divorcee, petulantly. \"That is not a bit the way\\r\\nit happened. That is the way I wish it had happened. Oh, no. I was\\r\\nbrought up to believe in the proprietary rights in marriage, and I did\\r\\nwhat I thought became a womanly woman. I asserted my rights, and made\\r\\na common or garden row.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor laughed, as she stamped her foot at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon--pardon,\" said he. \"I was only going to say \\'Thank God.\\' You\\r\\nknow I like it best that way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I had not told the old story,\" she said pettishly. \"It serves\\r\\nme quite right. Now I suppose they\\'ve got all sorts of queer notions\\r\\nin their heads.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense,\" said the Doctor. \"All authors, you know, run the risk of\\r\\ngetting mixed up in their romances--think of Charlotte Bronte.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not an author, and I am going to bed,--to repent of my folly,\"\\r\\nand she sailed into the house, leaving the Doctor gazing quizzically\\r\\nafter her. Before she was out of hearing, he called to her: \"I say,\\r\\nyou haven\\'t changed a bit since \\'92.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe heard but she did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LAWYER\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A BRIDE-ELECT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day we all hung about the garden, except the Youngster, who\\r\\ndisappeared on his wheel early in the day, and only came back, hot and\\r\\ndusty, at tea-time. He waved a hand at us as he ran through the garden\\r\\ncrying: \"I\\'ll change, and be with you in a moment,\" and leapt up the\\r\\noutside staircase that led to the gallery on which his room opened,\\r\\nand disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found an opportunity to go up the other staircase a little\\r\\nlater--the Youngster was an old pet of mine, and off and on, I had\\r\\nmothered him. I tapped at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t come in!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'ve you been?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait there a minute--and mum--. I\\'ll tell you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I went and sat in the window looking down the road, until he came,\\r\\nspick and span in white flannels, with his head not yet dried from the\\r\\ndouching he had taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here,\" he whispered, \"I know you can keep a secret. Well, I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen out toward Cambrai--only sixty miles--and I am tuckered. There\\r\\nwas a battle there last night--English driven back. They are only two\\r\\ndays\\' march away, and oh! the sight on the roads. Don\\'t let\\'s talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of myself, I expect I went white, for he exclaimed: \"Darn it,\\r\\nI suppose I ought not to have told you. But I had to let off to some\\r\\none. I don\\'t want to tell the Doctor. In fact, he forbade my going\\r\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it a real German victory?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it isn\\'t I don\\'t know what you\\'d call it, though such of the\\r\\nEnglish as I saw were in gay enough spirits, and there was not an\\r\\natmosphere of defeat. Fact is--I kept out of sight and only got stray\\r\\nimpressions. Go on down now, or they\\'ll guess something. I\\'m not going\\r\\nto say a word--yet. Awful sorry now I told you. Force of habit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went down. I had hard work for a few minutes to throw the impression\\r\\noff. But the garden was lovely, and tea being over, we all busied\\r\\nourselves in rifling the flowerbeds to dress the dinner table. If we\\r\\nwere going in two days, where was the good of leaving the flowers to\\r\\ndie alone? I don\\'t suppose that it was strange that the table\\r\\nconversation was all reminiscent. We talked of the old days: of\\r\\nourselves when we were boys and girls together: of old Papanti, and\\r\\nour first Cotillion, of Class Days, and, I remembered afterward, that\\r\\nnot one of us talked of ourselves except in the days of our youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the coffee came out, we looked about laughing to see which of the\\r\\nthree of us left was to tell the story. The Lawyer coughed, tapped\\r\\nhimself on his chest, and crossed his long legs.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a cold December afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air was piercing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been a slight fall of snow, then a sudden drop in the\\r\\nthermometer preceded nightfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Moreland, wrapped in her furs, was standing on a street corner,\\r\\nlooking in vain for a cab, and wondering, after all, why she had\\r\\nventured out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was somewhat later than she had supposed, and she was just\\r\\nconventional enough, in spite of her pose to the exact contrary, to\\r\\nhope that none of her friends would pass. She knew her set well enough\\r\\nto know that it would cause something almost like a scandal if she\\r\\nwere seen out alone, on foot, on the very eve of her wedding day, when\\r\\nall well bred brides ought to be invisible--repenting their sins, and\\r\\npraying for blessings on the future in theory, but in reality, fussing\\r\\nthemselves ill over belated finery.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had had for some years a number of poor protegees in the lower end\\r\\nof the city, which she had been accustomed to visit on work of a\\r\\ncharitable nature begun when she was a school girl. She had found work\\r\\nenough to do there ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was work of which her father, a hard headed man of business,\\r\\nstrongly disapproved, although he was ready enough to give his money.\\r\\nJack was of her father\\'s mind. She realized that when she returned\\r\\nfrom the three years\\' trip round the world, on which she was starting\\r\\nthe day after her wedding, she would have other duties, and she knew\\r\\nit would be harder to oppose Jack,--and more dangerous--than it had\\r\\nbeen to oppose her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this realization there was a touch of self-reproach. She knew, in\\r\\nher own heart, that she would be glad to do no more work of that sort.\\r\\nExperience had made her hopeless, and she had none of the spiritual\\r\\nsupport that made women like St. Catherine of Sienna. But, if\\r\\nexperience had robbed her of her illusions, she knew, too, that it had\\r\\nset a seal of pain on all the future for her. She could never forget\\r\\nthe misery she had seen. So it had been a little in a desire to give\\r\\none more sop to her conscience, that she had dedicated her last\\r\\nafternoon to freedom to her friends in the very worst part of the\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf her mother had remained at home, she would never have been allowed to\\r\\ngo. All the more reason for returning in good season, and here it was\\r\\ndark! Worse still, the trip had been in every way unsuccessful. She had\\r\\nturned her face homeward, simply asking herself, as she had done so many\\r\\ntimes before, if it were \"worth while,\" and answered the question once\\r\\nmore with: \"Neither to me nor to them.\" She had already learned, though\\r\\ntoo young for the lesson, that each individual works out his own\\r\\nsalvation,--that neither moral nor physical growth ever works from the\\r\\nsurface inward. Opportunity--she could perhaps give that in the future,\\r\\nbut she was convinced that those who may give of themselves, and really\\r\\nhelp in the giving, are elected to the task by something more than the\\r\\nmere desire to serve. In her case the gift of her youth and her\\r\\nillusions had done others no real good, and had more or less saddened\\r\\nher life forever. If she were to really go on with the work, it would\\r\\nonly be by giving up the world--her world,--abandoning her life, with\\r\\nits luxury, its love, everything she had been bred to, and longed for.\\r\\nShe did not feel a call to do that, so she chose the existence to which\\r\\nshe had been born; the love of a man in her own set,--but the shadow of\\r\\ntoo much knowledge sat on her like a shadow of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was impatient with herself, the world, living,--and there was no\\r\\ncab in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at her watch. Half past four.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was foolish not to have driven over, but she had felt it absurd,\\r\\nalways, to go about this kind of work in a private carriage, and\\r\\nto-day she could not, as she usually did, take a street car for fear\\r\\nof meeting friends. They thought her queer enough as it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn impatient ejaculation escaped her, and like an echo of it she heard\\r\\na child\\'s voice beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked down.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a poor miserable specimen. At first she was not quite sure\\r\\nwhether it were boy or girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhimpering and mopping its nose with a very dirty hand, the child\\r\\nbegged money for a sick mother--a dying mother--and begged as if not\\r\\naccustomed to it--all the time with an eye for that dread of New\\r\\nEngland beggars, the man in the blue coat and brass buttons.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Moreland was so consciously irritated with life that she was\\r\\nunusually gentle. She stooped down. The child did not seem six years\\r\\nold. The face was not so very cunning. It was not ugly, either. It was\\r\\nmerely the epitome of all that Miss Moreland tried to forget--the\\r\\nlittle one born without a chance in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a full appreciation of the child\\'s fear of the police,--begging\\r\\nis a crime in many American towns--she carefully questioned her,\\r\\nwatching for the dreaded officer herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the old story--a dying mother--no father--no one to do\\r\\nanything--a child sent out to cunningly defy the law, but it seemed to\\r\\nbe only for bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously the thing to do was to deliver the child up to the police.\\r\\nIt would be at once properly cared for, and the mother also.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Miss Moreland knew too much of official charity to be guilty of\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe easiest thing was to give her money. But, unluckily, she belonged\\r\\nto a society pledged not to give alms in the streets, and her sense of\\r\\nthe power of a moral obligation was a strong notion of duty, which had\\r\\ndescended to her from her Puritan ancestors. There was one thing left\\r\\nto do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know Chardon Street?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a flower shop on the corner. She led the child across to it,\\r\\nentered, and asked for an envelope. She wrote a few lines on a card,\\r\\nenclosed it and sealed the envelope. Then she went out to the\\r\\nside-walk again with the child. Stooping over her she made sure that\\r\\nthe little one really did know the street. \"It isn\\'t far from here,\"\\r\\nshe said. \"Give that to any one there, and somebody will go right home\\r\\nwith you to see your mother, to warm you, you poor little mite, and\\r\\nfeed you, and make you quite happy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not explain, and the child would not have understood, that she\\r\\nvouched for a special donation for the case as a sort of commemorative\\r\\ngift. The sum was large--it was a quixotic sort of salve to a sick\\r\\nconscience which told her that she ought to go herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child, still sobbing, turned away, and drearily started up the\\r\\nhill. She did not go far, however. Miss Moreland had her misgivings on\\r\\nthat point. And, just as she was about to draw a breath of relief,\\r\\nconvinced that, after all, she would go, the girl stopped deliberately\\r\\nin the shadow of a tree, and sat down on the snow-covered curbstone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo need to ask what the trouble was. The poor are born with a horror\\r\\nof organized charity. It obliges them to be looked over in all their\\r\\nmisery; it presumes a worthiness, or its pretence, which they resent\\r\\nalmost as much as they do the intrusion of the visiting committee.\\r\\nThis disinclination is as old as poverty, and is the rock ahead of all\\r\\norganized charity. Its exemplification was very trying to Miss\\r\\nMoreland at that moment, and the crouching figure was exasperating.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pursued the child. She pulled her rather roughly to her feet. It\\r\\nwas so provoking to have her sit down in the cold, and to so personify\\r\\nall that she wanted so ardently,--it was purely selfish, she knew\\r\\nthat,--to put out of her mind. There seemed but one thing to do: go\\r\\nwith the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew that if she did not, she would not sleep that night, nor\\r\\nsmile the next day--and that seemed so unfair to others. Besides, it\\r\\nwas not yet so very late.\\r\\n\\r\\nBidding the child hurry, she followed her up the hill, and down the\\r\\nother side to a part of the city with which she was not familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child cried quietly all the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Moreland was too vaguely uncomfortable to talk to her, as they\\r\\nhurried along.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in front of a dark house that they finally stopped, and went up\\r\\nthe stone steps into a hall so dark that she was obliged to take the\\r\\nchild\\'s dirty cold hands in hers to be sure of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was a foolish distaste for the contact, combined with her\\r\\nframe of mind, which prevented her from noticing facts far from\\r\\ntrifles, which came back to her afterward.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe groped her way up the uncarpeted stairs, and followed her still\\r\\nwhimpering guide along what seemed an upper corridor, stumbled on what\\r\\nshe immediately knew was the sill of a door, lurched forward as the\\r\\nchild let go of her hand, and, before she recovered her balance, the\\r\\ndoor closed behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe called to the child. No answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt for the door, found it--it was locked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in perfect darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrible wave of sickness passed over her and left her trembling and\\r\\nweak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll she had ever heard and found it difficult to believe, coursed\\r\\nthrough her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe folly of it all was worse. Fifteen minutes before all had been\\r\\nwell with her--and now--!\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough all her terror one idea was strong within her. She must keep\\r\\nher head, she must be calm, she must be alertly ready for whatever\\r\\nhappened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole thing had seemed so simple. The crying child had been so\\r\\nplausible! Yet--to enter a strange dark house, in an unknown part of\\r\\nthe city! How absurd it was of her! And that--after noticing--as she\\r\\nhad--that, cold as the halls were and uncarpeted, there was neither\\r\\nsmell of dirt nor humanity in the air!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile all these thoughts pursued one another through her mind she\\r\\nstood erect just inside the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe really dared not move.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a fear came to her that she might not be alone. For a moment\\r\\nthat fear dominated all other sensations. She held her breath, in a\\r\\nwild attempt to hear she knew not what.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was deathly still!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe backed to the door, and began cautiously feeling her way along the\\r\\nwall. Inch by inch, she crept round the room, startled almost to\\r\\nfainting at each obstacle she encountered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a large room with an alcove--a bedroom. There was but little\\r\\nfurniture, one door only, two windows covered with heavy drapery, the\\r\\nwindows bolted down, and evidently shuttered on the outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned to the door, one thing was certain, she was alone.\\r\\nThe only danger she need apprehend must come through that one door.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet she pushed a chair against the wall before she sat down to\\r\\nwait--for what? Ah, that was the horror of it! Was it robbery? There\\r\\nwas her engagement ring, a few ornaments like her watch, and very\\r\\nlittle money! Yet, as she had seen misery, even that might be worth\\r\\nwhile. But was this a burglar\\'s method? A ransom? That was too\\r\\nmediaeval for an American city. If neither, then what?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had but one enemy in the world, her Jack\\'s best friend, or at\\r\\nleast, he was his best friend until the days of her engagement. But he\\r\\nwas a gentleman, and these were the days when men did not revenge\\r\\nthemselves on women who frankly rejected the attentions they had never\\r\\nencouraged. It was weak, she knew it, to even remember the words he\\r\\nhad said to her when she had refused to hear the man she was to marry\\r\\nslandered by his chum--still she wished now that she had told Jack,\\r\\nall the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she could only have a light! There was gas, but no matches. To sit\\r\\nin the dark, waiting, she knew not what, was maddening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a new terror came over her. Suppose she should fall asleep from\\r\\nfatigue and exhaustion, and the effect of the dark?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed days that she sat there.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew afterward that it was only five hours and a half, but that\\r\\nfive hours and a half were an eternity--three hundred and thirty\\r\\nminutes, each one of which dragged her down, like a weight, into the\\r\\nblack abyss of the unknown; three hundred and thirty minutes of\\r\\nlistening to the labored beating of her own heart--it was an age,\\r\\nafter all!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly once did she lose control of herself. She imagined she heard\\r\\nvoices in the hall--that some one laughed--was there still laughter in\\r\\nthe world? In spite of herself, she rushed to the door, and pounded on\\r\\nit. This was so useless that she began to cry hysterically. Yet she\\r\\nknew how foolish that was, and she stumbled back to her chair, sank\\r\\ninto it, and calmed herself. She would not do that again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was her mother thinking? Poor mama! What would Jack say, when,\\r\\nat eleven o\\'clock, he ran in from his bachelor\\'s dinner--his\\r\\nlast--which he was giving to a few friends? What would her father say?\\r\\nHe had always prophesied some disaster for her excursions into the\\r\\nslums.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer imagination could easily picture the mad search that would be\\r\\nmade--but who could find a trace of her?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blackness, the fear, the dread, were doing their work! She was\\r\\nnumb! She began to feel as if she were suspended in space, as if\\r\\neverything had dropped away from her, as if in another instant she\\r\\nwould fall--and fall--and fall--.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly she heard a laugh in the hall again--this time there was no\\r\\nmistake about it, for it was followed by several voices. Some one\\r\\napproached the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nA key was inserted and turned in the lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe started to her feet, and steadied herself!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door swung open quickly--some one entered. By the dim light in the\\r\\nhall behind, she saw that it was a man--a gentleman in evening\\r\\nclothes, with a hat on the back of his head, and a coat over his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while her alert senses took that in, the door closed again--the\\r\\nman had remained inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought of making a dash for the door came to her, but it was too\\r\\nlate.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe heard the scratching of a match--a muttered oath at the darkness\\r\\nin a thick voice--then a sudden flood of light blinded her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew her hands quickly across her eyes, and was conscious that the\\r\\nman had flung his hat and coat on the bed before he turned to face\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment all her fear was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stumbled weakly as she ran toward him, crying hysterically, \"Jack,\\r\\ndear Jack, how did you find me? I should have gone mad if you had been\\r\\nmuch later! Take me home! Take me home--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Miss Moreland fainted, as a well-conducted girl of her class ought\\r\\nto have done, this would have been a very different kind of a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnluckily, or luckily, according as one views life--in the relief of\\r\\nhis presence, all danger of that fled. Unluckily for him, also, the\\r\\nappearance of his bride-elect in such an unexpected place was so\\r\\nappalling to him that his nerve failed him entirely. Instead of\\r\\nclasping her in his arms as he should have done, he had the decency\\r\\nto recoil, and cover his face instinctively from her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Moreland stopped as if turned to stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was conscious at first of but one thing--he had not expected to\\r\\nfind her there. He had not come to seek her. Then, for what?\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden flash illumined her ignorance, and behind it she grasped at\\r\\nthe vague accusation her other suitor had tried to make to her\\r\\nunwilling ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer outstretched hands fell to her sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe still leaned against the wall, where the shock had flung him. The\\r\\nexciting fumes of the wine he had drunk too recklessly evaporated, and\\r\\nonly a dim recollection remained in his absolutely sobered brain of\\r\\nthe idiotic wager, the ugly jest, the still more contemptible bravado\\r\\nthat had sent him into this hell.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not attempt to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her strained voice said: \"Take me home, please,\" he started and\\r\\nthe fear that had been on her face was now on his. A hundred dangers,\\r\\nof which she did not dream, stood between that room and a safe exit in\\r\\nwhich she should not be seen, and that much of this wretched\\r\\nbusiness--which he understood now only too well--miscarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started for the door. \"Stay here,\" he said. \"You are perfectly\\r\\nsafe,\" and he went out, and closed and locked the door behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the man who plotted without, and the woman who sat like a stone\\r\\nwithin that room, the next half hour were equally horrible. But time\\r\\nwas no longer measured by her!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe never remembered much more of that evening. She had a vague\\r\\nrecollection that he came back. She had a remembrance that he had\\r\\nhelped her stand--given her a glass of water--and led her down the\\r\\nuncarpeted stairs out into the street. Then she was conscious that she\\r\\nwalked a little way. Then that she had been helped into a carriage,\\r\\nand then she had jolted and jolted and jolted over the pavings, always\\r\\nwith his pale face opposite, and she knew that his eyes were full of\\r\\npity. Then everything seemed to stop, but it was only the carriage\\r\\nthat had come to a standstill. She was in front of her own door.\\r\\n\\r\\nA voice said in her ear, \"Can you stand?\" And she knew she was on the\\r\\nsteps. She heard the bell ring, but before her mother could catch her\\r\\nin her arms as she fell, she heard the carriage door bang, and he was\\r\\ngone forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that night she lay and tossed and wept and raved, and longed in\\r\\nher fever to die.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all night, he walked the streets marvelling at himself, at Nature,\\r\\nand at Civilization, between which he had so disastrously fallen, and\\r\\nwondering to how many men the irremediable had ever happened before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the next morning, early, messengers were flying about with notices\\r\\nof the bride\\'s illness.--Miss Moreland\\'s wedding was deferred by brain\\r\\nfever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she recovered, her hair was white, and she had lost all taste for\\r\\nmatrimony, but she had found instead that desire for anything rather\\r\\nthan personal existence, which made her the ardent, self-abnegating\\r\\nworker for the welfare of the downtrodden that the world knew her.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment of surprised silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome one coughed. No one laughed. Then the Journalist, always ready\\r\\nto leap into a breach, gasped: \"Horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Getting to be a pet word of yours,\" said the Lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Violinist tried to save the situation by saying gently: \"Well, I\\r\\ndon\\'t know. It is the commonest of all situations in a melodrama. So\\r\\nwhy fuss?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trained Nurse shrugged her shoulders. \"I know that story,\" she\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not,\" snapped the Lawyer. \"You may know _a_ story, but you\\r\\nnever heard that one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" she admitted. \"I am not going to add footnotes, don\\'t be\\r\\nalarmed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say that is a true story?\" ejaculated the Divorcee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for me,\" said the Critic, \"I don\\'t believe it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one asked you to,\" replied the Lawyer. \"It is only another case of\\r\\nthe Doctor\\'s pet theory--that whatever the mind of mortal mind can\\r\\nconceive, can come to pass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose also that it is a proof of another of his pet theories.\\r\\nScratch civilized man, and you find the beast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor was lying back in his chair. He never said a word. Somehow\\r\\nthe story seemed a less suggestive topic of conversation than usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The weather is going to change,\" said the Doctor. \"There\\'s rain in\\r\\nthe air.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, anyway,\" said the Journalist, as we gathered up our belongings\\r\\nand prepared to shut up for the night, \"the Youngster\\'s ghost story\\r\\nwas a good night cap compared to that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said the Critic. \"There\\'s the foundation of a bully\\r\\nmelodrama in that story, and I\\'m not sure that it isn\\'t the best one\\r\\nyet--so full of reserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No imagination, all the same,\" answered the Critic. \"As realistic in\\r\\nsubject, if not in treatment, as Zola.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now give us some shop jargon,\" laughed the Lawyer. \"You\\'ve not really\\r\\ntreated us to a true touch of your methods yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only do that,\" laughed the Critic, \"when I\\'m getting paid for it.\\r\\nAfter all, as the Violinist remarked, the situation is a favorite one\\r\\nin melodrama, from the money-coining \\'Two Orphans\\' down. The only\\r\\ntrouble is, the Lawyer poured his villain and hero into one mould. The\\r\\nother man ought to have trapped her, and the hero rescued her. But\\r\\nthat is only the difference between reality and art. Life is\\r\\ninartistic. Art is only choosing the best way. Life never does that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pig\\'s wrist,\" said the Doctor, and that settled the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JOURNALIST\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nIN A RAILWAY STATION\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A DANCER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday night, just as we were finishing dinner--we had eaten\\r\\ninside--the Divorcee said: \"It may not be in order to make the remark,\\r\\nbut I cannot help saying that it is so strange to think that we are\\r\\nsitting here so quietly in a country at war, suffering for nothing,\\r\\nvery little inconvenienced, even by the departure of all the men. The\\r\\nfield work seems to be going on just the same. Every one seems calm.\\r\\nIt is all most unexpected and strange to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see it that way at all,\" said the Journalist. \"I feel as if I\\r\\nwere sitting on a volcano, knowing it was going to erupt, but not\\r\\nknowing at what moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I understand,\" said the Divorcee, \"but that is not exactly what\\r\\nI mean. I meant that, in spite of _that_ feeling which every one\\r\\nbetween here and Paris must have, I see no outward signs of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are all about us just the same,\" remarked the Doctor, \"whether\\r\\nyou see them or not. Did it ever happen to you to be walking in some\\r\\nquiet city street, near midnight, when all the houses were closed, and\\r\\nonly here and there a street lamp gleamed, and here and there a ray of\\r\\nlight filtered through the shuttered window of some silent house, and\\r\\nto suddenly remember that inside all these dark walls the tragedies of\\r\\nlife were going on, and that, if a sudden wave of a magician\\'s wand\\r\\nwere to wipe away the walls, how horrified, or how amused one would\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Lawyer, \"I have had that idea many times, but it has\\r\\ncome to me more often in some hotel in the mountains of Switzerland. I\\r\\nremember one night sitting on the terrace at Murren, with the Jungfrau\\r\\nrising in bridal whiteness above the black sides of the\\r\\nSchwarze-Monch, and the moon shining so brightly over the slopes, that\\r\\nI could count any number of isolated little chalets perched on the\\r\\nledges, and I never had the feeling so strongly of life going on with\\r\\nall its joys and griefs and crimes, invisible, but oppressive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid,\" said the Doctor, \"that there is enough of it going on\\r\\nright here--if we only knew it. I had an example this afternoon. I was\\r\\nwalking through the village, when an old woman called to me, and asked\\r\\nif I were the doctor from the old Grange. I said I was, and she begged\\r\\nme to come in and see her daughter-in-law. She was very ill, and the\\r\\nlocal doctor is gone. I found a young, very pretty girl, with a tiny\\r\\nbaby, in as bad a state of hysteria as I ever saw. But that is not the\\r\\nstory. That I heard by degrees. It seems the father-in-law, a veteran\\r\\nof 1870, now old, and nearly helpless, is of good family, but married,\\r\\nin his middle age, a woman of the country. They had one son who was\\r\\nsent away to school, and became a civil engineer. He married, about\\r\\ntwo years ago, this pretty girl whom I saw. She is Spanish. He met her\\r\\nsomewhere in Southern Spain, and it was a desperate love match. The\\r\\nfirst child was born about six weeks before the war broke out. Of\\r\\ncourse the young husband was in the first class mobilized. The young\\r\\nwife is not French. She doesn\\'t care at all who governs France, so\\r\\nthat her man were left her in peace. I imagine that the old father\\r\\nsuspected this. He had never been happy that his one son married a\\r\\nforeigner. The instant the young wife realized that her man was\\r\\nexpected to put love of France before love of her, she began to make\\r\\nevery effort to induce him to go out of the country. To make a long\\r\\nstory short, the son went to his mother, whom he adored, made a clean\\r\\nbreast of the situation, and proposed that, to satisfy his wife, he\\r\\nshould start with her for the Spanish frontier, finding means to have\\r\\nher brother meet them there and take her home to her own people. He\\r\\npromised to make no effort to cross the frontier himself, and gave his\\r\\nword of honor to be with his regiment in time. He knew it would not be\\r\\neasy to do, and, in case of accident, he wished his mother to be able\\r\\nto explain to the old veteran. But the lad had counted without the\\r\\nspirit that is dominant in every French woman to-day. The mother\\r\\nlistened. She controlled herself. She did not protest. But that night,\\r\\nwhen the young couple were about to leave the house, carrying the\\r\\nsleeping baby, they found the old man, pistol in hand, with his back\\r\\nagainst the door. The words were few. The veteran stated that his son\\r\\ncould only pass over his dead body--that if he insisted, he would\\r\\nshoot him before he would allow him to pass: that neither wife nor\\r\\nchild should leave France. It was in vain that the wife, on her knees,\\r\\npleaded that she was not French--that the war did not concern\\r\\nher--that her husband was dearer to her than honor--and so forth. The\\r\\nold man declared that in marrying his son she became French, though\\r\\nshe was a disgrace to the name, that her son was a born Frenchman;\\r\\nthat she might go, and welcome, but that she would go without the\\r\\nchild, and, of course, that ended the argument. The next morning the\\r\\nbaby was christened, but the tale had leaked out. I suppose the\\r\\nSpanish wife had not kept her ideas absolutely to herself--and the son\\r\\njoined his regiment. The Spanish wife is still here, but, needless to\\r\\nsay, she is not at all loved by her husband\\'s family, who watch her\\r\\nlike lynxes for fear she will abduct the child, and she has developed\\r\\nas neat a case of hysterical mania of persecution as I ever\\r\\nencountered. So you see that even in this quiet place there are\\r\\ntragedies behind the walls. But I seem to be telling a story out of my\\r\\nturn!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a forbidden war story, at that,\" said the Youngster. \"So to\\r\\nchange the air--whose turn is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Journalist puffed out his chest. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said,\\r\\nas he rose to his feet, and struck, the traditional attitude of a\\r\\nmonologist, \"I regret to inform you that you will be obliged to have a\\r\\ntaste of my histrionic powers. I\\'ve got to act out part of this\\r\\nstory--couldn\\'t seem to tell it in any other form.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dora!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA slender young woman turned at the word, so sharply spoken over her\\r\\nshoulder, and visibly paled.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was strikingly attractive, in her modish tailor frock, and her\\r\\nshort tight jacket of Persian lamb, with its high, collar of grey fur\\r\\nturned up to her ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer singularly fair skin, her red hair, her brown eyes, with dark\\r\\nlashes, and narrowly pencilled eyebrows that were almost black, gave\\r\\nher a remarkable look, and at first sight suggested that Nature had\\r\\nnot done it all. But a closer observation convinced one that the\\r\\nstrange combination of such hair and such eyebrows was only one of\\r\\nthose freaks by which Nature now and then warns the knowing to beware\\r\\neven of marvellous beauty. In this case it stamped a woman as one\\r\\nwho--by several signs--might be identified by the initiated as one of\\r\\nthose, who, without reason or logic, spring now and again from most\\r\\nunpromising soil!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had walked the entire length of the station from the wide doors on\\r\\nthe street side to the swing doors at the opposite end which gave\\r\\nentrance to the tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she passed, no man had failed to turn and look after her, as, with\\r\\nher well hung skirts just clearing the wet pavement, she stepped\\r\\ndaintily over the flagging, and so lightly that neither boots nor\\r\\nskirt were the worse for it. One sees women in Paris who know that\\r\\nart, but it is rare in an American.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe must have been long accustomed to attracting masculine eyes, and\\r\\nno wonder, for when she stepped into the place she seemed to give a\\r\\ncolor to the atmosphere, and everything and everybody went grey and\\r\\ncommonplace beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a terrible night in November.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow was falling rapidly outside, and the wind blew as it can blow\\r\\nonly on the New England coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the sort of night that makes one forced to be out look forward\\r\\nlovingly to home, and think pityingly of the unfortunate, while those\\r\\nwithin doors involuntarily thank God for comfort, and hug at whatever\\r\\nremnant of happiness living has left them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway station was crowded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm had come up suddenly at the close of a fair day. It was the\\r\\nhour, too, at which tradespeople, clerks, and laborers were returning\\r\\nhome to the suburbs, and at which the steamboat express for New York\\r\\nwas being made up--although it was not an encouraging night for the\\r\\nlatter trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pretty young woman with the red hair had looked through the door\\r\\nnear the tracks, and glanced to the right, where the New York express\\r\\nshould be. The gate was still closed. She was much too early! For a\\r\\nsecond she hesitated. She glanced about quickly, and the look was not\\r\\nwithout apprehension. It was evident that she did not see the man who\\r\\nwas following her, and who seemed to have been waiting for her near\\r\\nthe outer door. He did not speak, nor attract her attention in any\\r\\nway. The crowd served him in that!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s hesitation, she turned toward the ladies\\' waiting\\r\\nroom, and just as she was about to enter, the man behind addressed\\r\\nher--and the word was said so low that no one near heard it--though,\\r\\nby the start she gave, it might have been a pistol shot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dora!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood perfectly still. The color died out of her face; but only\\r\\nfor an instant. She looked alarmed, then perplexed, and then she\\r\\nsmiled. She was evidently a young woman of resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was a stalwart handsome fellow of his class--though it was\\r\\nalmost impossible to guess what that was save that it was not that\\r\\nwhich the world labels by exterior signs \"gentleman.\" He might easily\\r\\nhave been some sort of a mechanic. He was certainly neither a clerk\\r\\nnor the follower of any of the unskilled professions. He was surely\\r\\ncountrybred, for there was a largeness in his expression as well as\\r\\nhis bearing that spoke distinctly of broad vistas and exercise. He was\\r\\ntall and broad-shouldered. He stood well on his feet, hampered as\\r\\nlittle by his six feet of height and fourteen stone weight as he was\\r\\nby the size of his hands. One would have easily backed him to ride\\r\\nwell and shoot straight, though he probably never saw the inside of\\r\\nwhat is called a \"drawing-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the fire of a mighty emotion in his deep-set eyes. There\\r\\nwere signs of a tremendous animal force in his square chin and thick\\r\\nneck, but it was balanced well by his broad brow and wide-set eyes. He\\r\\nseemed at this moment to hold himself in check with a rigid\\r\\nstubbornness that answered for his New England origin, and Puritan\\r\\nancestry! Indeed, at the moment he addressed the woman, but for his\\r\\neyes, he might have seemed as indifferent as any of the stone figures\\r\\nthat upheld the iron girders of the roof above him!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill smiling archly she moved forward into the waiting room and,\\r\\npassing through the dense crowd that hung about the door, crossed the\\r\\nroom to an open space.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word the man followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was dimly lighted. The crowd that surged about them, coming\\r\\nand going, and sometimes pressing close on every side, seemed not to\\r\\nnote them. And, if they had, they would have seen nothing more\\r\\nremarkable than an extremely pretty young woman conversing quietly\\r\\nwith a big fellow in a reefer and long boots--a rig he carried well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dora!\" he said again, and then had to pause to steady his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nDora wet her red lips with the pointed tip of her tiny tongue;\\r\\nswallowed nervously once or twice, before she spoke. She was now\\r\\nfacing him, and still smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe kept his eyes fixed on her face. He did not respond to the smile.\\r\\nHis eyes were tragic. He seemed to be seeking something in her face as\\r\\nif he feared her mere words would not help him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Zeke,\" she said at last, when she realized that he could not get\\r\\nbeyond her name, \"I thought you had gone home an hour ago! Why didn\\'t\\r\\nyou take the 5.15 train?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I changed my mind! To tell you the truth, I heard that you were in\\r\\ntown this afternoon. I have been watching for you--for some time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I can say is--you are foolish. Where\\'s the good for you\\r\\nfretting yourself so? I can take care of myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t get used to you being about in the city streets alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How absurd!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been absurd a great many times of late--in your eyes. Our\\r\\nideas don\\'t seem to agree any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Zeke, they don\\'t!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why speak to me in that tone, Dora? Don\\'t do it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked over her head, as if to be sure of his hold on himself. He\\r\\nwas ghastly white about his smooth-shaven, thick lips. Both hands were\\r\\nthrust deep into his reefer pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s come to you, Zeke?\" she asked nervously. His was not exactly\\r\\nthe face one would see unmoved!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her without looking at her. It was evident he did not dare\\r\\njust yet. \"Nothing much, I reckon. I\\'ve been a bit down all day. I\\r\\nreally don\\'t know why, myself. I\\'ve had a queer presentiment, as if\\r\\nsomething were going to happen. As if something terrible were coming\\r\\nto me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m sorry. You\\'ve no occasion to feel like that, I\\'m sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, if you say so. What train shall we take?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stretched out one hand to take the small bag she carried.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shrank back instinctively, and withdrew the bag. He must have felt\\r\\nrather than seen the movement, it was so slight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hand fell to his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, he persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m dead done up, Dora. I need my dinner, come on!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you\\'d better take the 6.00 train. You\\'ve just time,\" she said\\r\\nhurriedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right. Come on!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid his hand on her shoulder with a gesture that was entreating.\\r\\nIt was the first time he had touched her. A frightened look came into\\r\\nher eyes. He did not see it, for he was still avoiding her face. It\\r\\nwas as if he were afraid of reading something there he did not wish to\\r\\nknow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer red lips had taken on a petulant expression--that of one who hated\\r\\nto be \"stirred up.\" In a childish voice--which only thinly veiled an\\r\\nobstinate determination--she pouted: \"I\\'m not going--yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were said almost under her breath, as if she were fearful of\\r\\ntheir effect on him, yet was determined to carry her point.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man only sighed deeply as he replied: \"I thought your dancing\\r\\nlessons were over. I hoped I was no longer to spend my evenings alone.\\r\\nAlone! Looking round at the things that are yours, and among which I\\r\\nfeel so out of place, except when you are there to make me forget.\\r\\nGod! What damnable evenings I\\'ve spent there--feeling as if you were\\r\\nslipping further and further out of my life--as if you were gone, and\\r\\nI had only the clothes you had worn, an odor about me somewhere to\\r\\nconvince me that I had not dreamed you! Sometimes that faint,\\r\\nindistinct, evasive scent of you in the room has almost driven me out\\r\\nof my head. I wonder I haven\\'t killed you before now--to be sure of\\r\\nyou! I\\'m afraid of Hell, I suppose, or I should have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman did not look at all alarmed. Indeed there was a light in her\\r\\namber eyes that spoke of a kind of gratification in stirring this\\r\\nyoung giant like that--this huge fellow that could so easily crush\\r\\nher--but did not! She knew better why than he did--but she said\\r\\nnothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his eyes still fixed on space--after a pause--he went on: \"I was\\r\\nfool enough to believe that that was all over, at last, that you had\\r\\ndanced to your heart\\'s content, and that we were to begin the old\\r\\nlife--the life before that nonsense--over again. You were like my old\\r\\nDora all day yesterday! The Dora I loved and courted and married back\\r\\nthere in the woods. But I might have known it wasn\\'t finished by the\\r\\nache I had here,\" and he struck himself a blow over the heart with his\\r\\nclenched fist, \"when I waked this morning, and by the weight I\\'ve\\r\\ncarried here all day.\" And he drew a deep breath like one in pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman looked about as if apprehensive that even his passionate\\r\\nundertone might have attracted attention, but only a man by the\\r\\nradiator seemed to have noticed, and he had the air of being not quite\\r\\nsober enough to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman glanced nervously at the clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was again staring over her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quarter to six. Her precious minutes were flying. She must be\\r\\nrid of him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, Zeke, dear,\" she said, in desperation, speaking very\\r\\nrapidly under her breath--no fear but he would hear--\"the truth is,\\r\\nthat I\\'m not a bit better satisfied with our sordid kind of life than\\r\\nI was a year ago, when we first discussed it. I\\'m awfully sorry! You\\r\\nknow that. But I can\\'t change--and there is the whole truth! It\\'s not\\r\\nyour fault in one way--and yet in one way it is. God knows you have\\r\\ndone everything you could, and more some ways than you ought. But,\\r\\nunluckily for you, gratifying me was not the way to mend the situation\\r\\nfor yourself. It is cruel--but it is the truth! If a man wants to keep\\r\\na woman of my disposition attached to him, he\\'d do far better to beat\\r\\nher than over-educate her, and teach her all the beauties of freedom.\\r\\nHe should keep her ignorant, rather than cultivate her imagination,\\r\\nand open up the wonders of the world to her. It\\'s rough on chaps like\\r\\nyou, that with all your cleverness you\\'ve no instinct to set you right\\r\\non a point like this--but it is lucky for women like me--at times! You\\r\\nwere determined to force all this out of me, so you may as well hear\\r\\nthe whole brutal truth. I\\'m sick of our stupid ways of life--I have\\r\\nbeen sick of it for a long time. I\\'ve passed all power to pretend any\\r\\nlonger. I have learned that there is a great and beautiful world\\r\\nwithin the reach of women who are clever enough and brave enough to\\r\\ngrasp at an opportunity, without looking forward or back. I want to\\r\\nwalk boldly to this. I\\'m not afraid of the stepping-stones! This is\\r\\nreally all your fault. When you married me, five years ago, I was only\\r\\nsixteen, and very much in love with you. Now, why didn\\'t you make me\\r\\ndo the housework and drudge as all the other women on the farms about\\r\\nyours did? I\\'d have done it then, and willingly, even to the washing\\r\\nand scrubbing. I had been working in a cotton mill. I didn\\'t know\\r\\nanything better than to drudge. I thought that was a woman\\'s lot. It\\r\\ndidn\\'t even seem terrible to me. But no--you set yourself to amuse me.\\r\\nYou brought me way up to town on a wedding journey. For the first time\\r\\nin my life I saw there idle women in the world, who wore soft clothes\\r\\nand were always dressed up. You bought me finery. I was clever and\\r\\nimitative. I pined for all the excitement and beauty of city life when\\r\\nwe were back on the farm, in the life you loved. I cried for it, as a\\r\\nchild cries for the moon. I never dreamed of getting it. And you\\r\\nsurprised me by selling the farm, and coming nearer the town to live.\\r\\nJust because I had an ear for music, and could pick out tunes on the\\r\\nold melodeon, I must have a piano and take lessons. Just because my\\r\\nmusic teacher happened to be French and I showed an aptitude for\\r\\nstudying, that must be gratified. Can you really blame me if I want to\\r\\nsee more of the wide world that opened up to me? Did you really think\\r\\nFrench novels and music were likely to make a woman of my lively\\r\\nimagination content with her lot as wife of a mechanic--however\\r\\nclever?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked down at her as if stunned. Arguments of that sort were\\r\\na bit above the reasoning of the simple masculine animal, who seemed\\r\\nto belong to that race which comprehends little of the complex\\r\\nemotions, and looks on love as the one inevitable passion of life, and\\r\\non marriage as its logical result and everlasting conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was probable at this moment that he completed his alphabet in the\\r\\ngreat lesson of life--and spelled out painfully the awful truth, that\\r\\nnot all the royal service of worship and love in a man\\'s heart can\\r\\nhold a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something akin to a sob in his throat as he replied: \"You\\r\\nwere so young--so pretty! I could not bear to think that you should\\r\\nsoil your hands for me! I wanted to make up to you for all the\\r\\nhardships and sorrows of your childhood. I dreamed of being mother and\\r\\nfather as well as husband to you. I thought it would make you happy to\\r\\nowe everything to me--as happy as it made me to give. I would\\r\\nwillingly have carried you every step of your life, rather than you\\r\\nshould have tired your feet. Is that a sin in a woman\\'s eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA whimsical smile broke over the woman\\'s face. It quivered on her red\\r\\nlips for just a breath, as if conscious how ill-timed it was. \"I\\r\\nreally like to tire my feet,\" she murmured, and she pointed the toe of\\r\\nher tiny boot, as if poised to dance, and looked down on it with\\r\\nevident admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man caught his breath sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s that damned dancing that has upset you, Dora!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sh! Don\\'t swear! I do like dancing! I have always told you so. It was\\r\\nyou who first admired it. It was you who let me learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were my wife! I thought that meant everything to you that it\\r\\nmeant to me. I loved your beauty because it was yours; your pleasures\\r\\nbecause they gave you pleasure. All my ideas of right and wrong in\\r\\nmarriage which I learned in my father\\'s honest house bent to your\\r\\ndesires and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked nervously at the clock. Ten minutes to six.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dora--for God\\'s sake look at me! Dora--you\\'re not leaving me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an almost inarticulate cry, as of a man who had foreseen his\\r\\ndoom, and only protested from some unconquerable instinct to struggle!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe patted his clenched hand gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was plainly evident that she hated the sight of suffering, and\\r\\nhated more not having her own way, and was possessed by a refined kind\\r\\nof cowardice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t make a row, there\\'s a dear boy! It is like this: I am going\\r\\nover to New York, just for a few weeks. I would have told you\\r\\nyesterday, only I hated spoiling a nice day. It was a nice day?--with\\r\\na scene. You\\'ll find a nice long letter at home--it\\'s a sweet one,\\r\\ntoo--telling you all about it. Don\\'t take it too hard! I am going to\\r\\nearn fifty dollars a week--just fancy that--and don\\'t blame me too\\r\\nmuch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe didn\\'t seem to hear! He hung his head--the veins in his forehead\\r\\nswelled--there were actually tears in his eyes--and the mighty effort\\r\\nhe made to restrain a sob was terrible--and six feet of American\\r\\nmanhood, as fine a specimen of the animal as the soil can show,\\r\\nanimated by a spirit which represented well the dignity of toil and\\r\\nself-respect, stood bowed down with ungovernable grief and shame\\r\\nbefore a merely ornamental bit of femininity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFate had simply perpetrated another of her ghastly pleasantries!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman was perplexed--naturally! But it was evidently the sight of\\r\\nher work, and not the work, itself, that pained her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t cut up so rough, Zeke, please don\\'t,\" she went on. \"I\\'m very\\r\\nfond of you--you know that--but I detest the odor of the shop, and it\\r\\nis so easy for us both to escape it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrank as if she had struck him.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstinctively he must have remembered the cotton mill from which he\\r\\ntook her. A man rarely understands a woman\\'s faculty for\\r\\nforgetting--that is to say, no man of his class does.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Doesn\\'t it seem a bit selfish of you,\" she went on, \"to object to my\\r\\nearning nearly three times what you can--and so easily--and prettily?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted you to be happy with what I could give you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m not. No use to fib about it! It is too late.\\r\\nYour notions are so queer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose it is queer to love one woman--and to love her so that\\r\\nlaboring for her is happiness! I suppose you do find me a queer chap,\\r\\nbecause I am not willing that my wife--flesh of my flesh--should\\r\\nflaunt herself, half dressed, to excite the admiration of other\\r\\nmen--all for fifty dollars a week!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See here, Zeke, you are making too much of this! If it is the\\r\\nseparation you can\\'t stand--why come, too! I\\'ll soon enough be getting\\r\\nmy hundred a week, and more. That is enough for both of us. You can be\\r\\nwith me, if that is what you mind!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If that is what I mind? You know better than that! Am I such a cur\\r\\nthat you think, if there were no other reason, I\\'d pose before the\\r\\nworld as the husband of a woman who owes nothing to him--as if I\\r\\nwere--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe interrupted him sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What odds does it make--tell me that--which of us earns the money? To\\r\\nhave it is the only important thing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man straightened up--and squared his broad shoulders. A strange\\r\\nchange came over him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid his heavy hand on her shoulder, and, for the first time, he\\r\\nspoke with a disregard for self-control, although he did not raise his\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at me, Dora, and be sure I mean what I say. Leave me to-day, and\\r\\ndon\\'t you ever come back to me. It may kill me to live without you.\\r\\nWell, better that than--than the other! I married you to live with\\r\\nyou--not merely to have you! I\\'ve been a faithful husband to you! I\\r\\nshall remain that while I live. I never denied you anything I could\\r\\nget for you! But this I will not put up with! I thought you loved\\r\\nme--even if you were sometimes vain, and now and then cruel. If you\\'re\\r\\nill--if you disappoint yourself, I\\'ll be ready to take care of you--as\\r\\nI promised. But don\\'t never dare to come back to me otherwise! Unless\\r\\nyou\\'re in want and homeless, unless you can\\'t live, but by the labor\\r\\nof my hands, I\\'ll never sleep under the same roof with you again.\\r\\nNever!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What nonsense, Zeke! Of course I\\'ll come back! You won\\'t turn me\\r\\naway! I only want to see a little of the world, to get a few of the\\r\\nthings you can\\'t give me--no blame to you, either!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not seem to hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost as if speaking to himself, he went on: \"I\\'ve feared for some\\r\\ntime you didn\\'t love me. I didn\\'t want to believe it. I was a coward.\\r\\nI shut my eyes. I took what you gave me--I daren\\'t think of\\r\\nthis--which has come to me! I dared not! God punishes idolatry! He has\\r\\npunished mine. Be sure you\\'re not making a mistake, Dora! There may be\\r\\nother men will admire you, my girl--will any of them love you as I do?\\r\\nThere\\'s never a minute I\\'m not conscious of you, sleeping or waking.\\r\\nThink again, Dora, before you leave me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t, Zeke. I\\'ve signed a contract. I couldn\\'t reconsider if I\\r\\nwanted to. It\\'s just seven minutes to train time. Kiss me--there\\'s a\\r\\ndear lad--and don\\'t row me any more!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised herself on tip toes and approached her red lips to his\\r\\nface--lips of an intense color to go with the marked pallor of the\\r\\nrest of the face, and which surely were never offered to him in vain\\r\\nbefore--but he was beyond their seduction at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve decided?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right! Good-bye, then! You promised to cleave to me through thick\\r\\nand thin \\'till death did us part.\\' I\\'ll have no halfway business,\" and\\r\\nhe turned on his heel, and without looking back he pushed his way\\r\\nthrough the crowd, which chatted and fussed and never even noted the\\r\\npassing of a broken heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pretty creature watched him out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a humorous pout on her lips. But she seemed so sure of her\\r\\nman! He would come back, of course--when she called him--if she ever\\r\\ndid! Probably she liked him better at that moment than she had liked\\r\\nhim in two years. He had opposed her. He had defied her power over\\r\\nhim. He had once more become a man to conquer--if she ever had time!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just now there was something more important. That train! It was\\r\\nthree minutes to the schedule time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he disappeared into the crowd she drew a breath of relief, and\\r\\nhurried out of the waiting room and pushed her way to the platform,\\r\\nalong which she hurried to the parlor car, where she seated herself\\r\\ncomfortably, as if no man with a broken life had been set down that\\r\\nday against her record.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, she could not quite rid herself of thoughts of his face,\\r\\nbut the recollection rather flattered her, and did not in the least\\r\\nprevent her noticing the looks of admiration with which two men on the\\r\\nopposite side of the car were regarding her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce or twice she glanced out of the window, apparently alternately\\r\\nexpecting and dreading to see her stalwart husband come sprinting down\\r\\nthe platform for the kiss he had refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe didn\\'t come!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was relieved as the train started--yet she hated to feel he could\\r\\nreally let her go like that!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe never guessed at the depth of suffering she had brought him. How\\r\\ncould she appreciate what she could never feel? She never dreamed that\\r\\nas the train pulled out into the storm he stood at the end of the\\r\\nstation, and watched it slowly round the curve under the bridge and\\r\\npass out of sight. No one was near to see him turn aside, and rest his\\r\\narms against the brick wall, to bury his face in them, and sob like a\\r\\nchild, utterly oblivious of the storm that beat upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on,\" yelled the Youngster, \"where\\'s the claque?\" And he began to\\r\\napplaud furiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if there is a claque, the rest of us don\\'t need to exert\\r\\nourselves,\" said the Lawyer, indolently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I say,\" asked the Youngster, after the Journalist had made his\\r\\nbest bow. \"I AM disappointed. Was that all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My goodness,\" commented the Doctor, as he lighted a fresh cigar.\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t that enough?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for _me_,\" replied the Youngster. \"I want to know about her\\r\\n_debut_. Was she a success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" answered the Journalist. \"That sort always is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I want to know,\" insisted the Youngster, \"what became of him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" ejaculated the Sculptor, \"of course he cut his big brown\\r\\nthroat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said the Critic. \"He probably went up to New York,\\r\\nand hung round the stage door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Until she called in the police, and had him arrested as a common\\r\\nnuisance,\" added the Lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll bet my microscope he didn\\'t,\" laughed the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you won\\'t lose your lens,\" replied the Journalist. \"He never did\\r\\na blooming thing--that is, he didn\\'t if he existed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my eyes,\" said the Youngster. \"I am disappointed again. I thought\\r\\nthat was a simon-pure newspaper yarn--one of your reporter\\'s\\r\\ndodges--real journalese!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is true enough,\" answered the Journalist, \"and her feet are true,\\r\\nand so is her red hair, and, unless she is a liar, and most actresses\\r\\nare, so is he and her origin, but as for the way she cut him\\r\\nout--well, I had to make that up. It is better than any of the six\\r\\ntales she told as many interviewers, in strict secrecy, in the days\\r\\nwhen she was collecting hearts and jewels and midnight suppers in New\\r\\nYork.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is she still there?\" asked the Youngster, \"because if she is, I\\'ll go\\r\\nback and take a look at Dora myself--after the war!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Youngster,\" laughed the Journalist, \"it will have to be \\'after\\r\\nthe war,\\' as you will probably have to go to Berlin to find her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all right!\" retorted the Youngster. \"I _am_ going--with the\\r\\nAllied armies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all jumped up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" cried the Divorcee. \"No!!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I am. Where\\'s the good of keeping it secret? I enlisted the day I\\r\\nwent to Paris the first time--so did the Doctor, so did the Critic,\\r\\nand so did _he_, the innocent looking old blackguard,\" and he seized\\r\\nthe Journalist by both shoulders and shook him well. \"He thought we\\r\\nwouldn\\'t find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well,\" said the Journalist, \"when one has seen three wars, one\\r\\nmay as well see one more.--This will surely be my last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anyway,\" cried the Youngster, \"we\\'ll see it all round--the Doctor in\\r\\nthe Field Ambulance, me in the air, the Critic is going to lug\\r\\nlitters, and as for the Journalist--well, I\\'ll bet it\\'s secret service\\r\\nfor him! Oh, I know you are not going to tell, but I saw you coming\\r\\nout of the English Embassy, and I\\'ll bet my machine you\\'ve a ticket\\r\\nfor London, and a letter to the Chief in your pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bet away,\" said the Critic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'d I tell you--what\\'d I tell you? He speaks every God-blessed\\r\\nlanguage going, and if it wasn\\'t that, he\\'d tell fast enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind,\" said the Trained Nurse, \"so that he goes somewhere--with\\r\\nthe rest of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--YOU?\" exclaimed the Divorcee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? I was trained for this sort of thing. This is my chance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the rest of us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor intervened. \"See here, this is forty-eight hours or more\\r\\nearlier than I meant this matter to come up. I might have known the\\r\\nYoungster could not hold his tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been bursting for three days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'ve burst now, and I hope you are content. There is nothing\\r\\nto worry about, yet. We fellows are leaving September 1st. The roads\\r\\nare all clear, and it was my idea that we should all start for Paris\\r\\ntogether early next Tuesday morning. I don\\'t know what the rest of you\\r\\nwant to do, but I advise _you_,\" turning to the Divorcee, \"to go back\\r\\nto the States. You would not be a bit of good here. You may be there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right,\" she replied sadly. \"I\\'d be worse than no good.\\r\\nI\\'d need \\'first aid,\\' at the first shot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going with her,\" said the Sculptor. \"I\\'d be more useless than she\\r\\nwould.\" And he turned a questioning look at the Lawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go back. I\\'ve business to attend to. Anyway, I\\'d be an\\r\\nencumbrance here. I may be useful there. Who knows?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me, every one knew what I proposed to do, and that left every\\r\\none accounted for except the Violinist. He had been in his favorite\\r\\nattitude by the tree, just as he had been on that evening when it had\\r\\nbeen proposed to \"tell stories,\" gazing first at one and then at\\r\\nanother, as the hurried conversation went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, finding all eyes turned on him, \"I am going to London\\r\\nwith the Journalist--if he is really going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, I am,\" was the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And from London I shall get to St. Petersburg. I have a dream that\\r\\nout of all this something may happen to Poland. If it does, I propose\\r\\nto be there. I\\'ll be no good at holding a gun--I could never fire one.\\r\\nBut if, by some miracle, there comes out of this any chance for the\\r\\n\\'Fair Land of Poland\\' to crawl out, or be dragged out, from under the\\r\\nfeet of the invader--well, I\\'ll go _home_--and--and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And grow up with the country,\" shouted the Youngster. \"Bully for\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may only go back to fiddle over the ruins. But who knows? At all\\r\\nevents, I\\'ll go back and carry with me all that your country had done\\r\\nfor three generations of my family. They\\'ll need it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"that is all settled. Enough for to-night.\\r\\nWe\\'ll still have one or two, and it may be three days left together.\\r\\nLet us make the most of them. They will never come again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And to think what a lovely summer we had planned,\" sighed the\\r\\nDivorcee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tush!\" ejaculated the Doctor. \"We had a lovely time all last year. As\\r\\nfor this summer, I imagine that it has been far finer than what we\\r\\nplanned. Anyway, let us be thankful that it was _this_ summer that we\\r\\nall found one another again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better go to bed,\" cried the Critic; \"the Doctor is getting\\r\\nsentimental--a bad sign in an army surgeon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" remarked the Trained Nurse; \"I\\'ve seen those that were\\r\\nmore sentimental than the Journalist, and none the worse for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VIOLINIST\\'S STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SOUL OF THE SONG\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALE OF A FIANCEE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday most of the men made a run into Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had finally been decided as best that, if all went well, we should\\r\\nleave for Paris some time the next day. There were steamer tickets to\\r\\nattend to. There were certain valuables to be taken up to the Bank.\\r\\nThe Divorcee had a trunk or two that she thought she ought to send in\\r\\norder that we might start with as little luggage as possible, so both\\r\\nchauffeurs were sent up to town with baggage, and orders to wait\\r\\nthere. The rest of us had been busy doing a little in the way of\\r\\ndismantling the house. The unexpected end of our summer had come. It\\r\\nwas sad, but I imagine none of us were sorry, under the circumstances,\\r\\nto move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly dinner time when the cars came back, almost together,\\r\\nand we were surprised to see the Doctor going out to the servants\\'\\r\\nquarters instead of joining us as he usually did. In fact, we did not\\r\\nsee him until we went into the dining room for dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he came to the head of the table, he said: \"My good people, we will\\r\\nserve ourselves as best we can with the cook\\'s aid. We have no\\r\\nwaitress to-night. But it is our last dinner. A camp under marching\\r\\norders cannot fuss over trifles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Angele?\" asked the Divorcee. \"Is she ill?\" And she turned to\\r\\nthe door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come back!\" said the Doctor, sharply. \"You can\\'t help her now. Better\\r\\nleave her alone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if by instinct, we all knew what had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who brought the news?\" some one asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They gave it to me at the _Mairie_ as I passed,\" replied the Doctor,\\r\\n\"and the _garde champetre_ told me what the envelope contained. He\\r\\nfell at Charleroi.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Angele,\" exclaimed the Trained Nurse. \"Are you sure I could not\\r\\nhelp her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure,\" said the Doctor. \"She took it as a Frenchwoman should. She\\r\\nsnatched the baby from its cradle, and held it a moment close to her\\r\\nface. Then she lifted it above her head in both hands, and said,\\r\\nalmost without a choke in her throat, _\\'Vive la France, quand\\r\\nmeme!_\\'--and dropped. I put them on the bed together, she and the boy.\\r\\nShe was crying like a good one when I left her. She\\'s all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor child--and that tiny baby!\" exclaimed the Divorcee, wiping her\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fudge,\" said the Doctor. \"She is the widow of a hero, and the mother\\r\\nof the hero\\'s son. Considering what life is, that is to be one of the\\r\\nelect of Fate. She\\'ll go through life with a halo round her head, and,\\r\\nlike most of the French women I have seen, she\\'ll wear it like a\\r\\ncrown. It becomes us, in the same spirit, to partake of the food\\r\\nbefore us. This life is a wonderful spectacle. If you saw an episode\\r\\nlike that in a drama, at the theatre, you would all cheer like mad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe knew he was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Youngster could not help adding, \"That\\'s twice--two days\\r\\nrunning, that the Doctor has told a story out of his turn, and both\\r\\ntimes he outraged the consign, for both times it was a war story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat seemed to break the ice. We talked more or less war during\\r\\ndinner, but this time there were no disputes. Still I think we were\\r\\nglad when the cook trotted in with the trays, and with our elbows on\\r\\nthe table, we turned toward the Violinist, who leaned against the high\\r\\nback of his chair, and with his long white hands resting on the carved\\r\\narms, and his eyes on the ceiling--an attitude that he did not change\\r\\nduring the narrative, began:\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the early eighties that I returned from Germany to my native\\r\\nland, and settled myself and my violin in the city of my birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not rich as my countrymen judge wealth, but, in my own\\r\\nestimation, I was well to do. I had enough to live without labor, and\\r\\nwas, therefore, able to devote myself to my art without considering\\r\\ntoo closely the recompense.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to that, I was still young.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had more love for my chosen mistress--Music--than the Goddess had\\r\\nfor me, for, while she accepted my worship with indulgence, she wasted\\r\\nfewer gifts on me than fell to the lot of many a less faithful\\r\\nfollower.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, I was happy and content in my love for her, and only needed her\\r\\nto keep me so until, a year after my return, I met one woman, loved\\r\\nher, and begged her to share with my music, my heart, and its\\r\\nadoration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat satisfied her, since, in her own love for the same art, she used\\r\\nto assure me that she possessed, by proxy, that other half of myself\\r\\nwhich I still dedicated to the Muse.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was the vibrant spirit of this woman which seemed musical\\r\\nto me, and which I so ardently loved, for she appeared to have a\\r\\nveritable violin soul. Her face was often the medium through which I\\r\\nsaw the spirit of the music I was playing, as it sang in gladness,\\r\\nsobbed in sadness, thrilled in passion along the strings of my Amati.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that I never played so well as when her face was before me. I\\r\\nfelt that if ever I approached my dreams in achievement, it would be\\r\\nher soul that inspired me. So like was she, in my fancy, to a musical\\r\\ninstrument, that I used to tell her, when the wind swept across her\\r\\nburnished hair, that the air was full of melody. And when she looked\\r\\nespecially ethereal--as she did at times--I would catch her in my\\r\\narms, and bid her tell me, on peril of her life, what song was hidden\\r\\nin her heart, that I might teach it to my violin, and die great. Yet,\\r\\nremarkable as it seems to me still, the Spirit of Music that surely\\r\\ndwelt within her, dwelt there a dumb prisoner. It had no audible\\r\\nvoice, though I was not alone in feeling its presence in her eyes, on\\r\\nher lips, in her spiritual charm.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a voice that was melody itself, yet she never sang. I always\\r\\nfancied her hands were a musician\\'s hands, yet she never played. This\\r\\nwas the more singular as her mother had been a great singer, and her\\r\\nfather, while he had never risen above the desk of _chef d\\'orchestre_\\r\\nin a local playhouse, was no mean musician.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, when the charm of her spirit was on me, I would pretend to\\r\\nweave a spell about her, and conjure the spirit that was imprisoned in\\r\\nthe heart that was mine, to come forth from the shrine he was so\\r\\nimpudently usurping.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, those were the days of my youth!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been betrothed but a brief time when Rodriguez, for some\\r\\nseasons a European celebrity, made his first appearance in our city.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had heard most of the great violinists of that time, had known some\\r\\nof them well, had played with many of them, as I did later with\\r\\nRodriguez, but I had never chanced to see or hear him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis fame had, however, preceded him. The newspapers were full of him.\\r\\nFaster even than the tales of his genius had travelled the tales of\\r\\nhis follies--tales that out-Don-Juaned the famous rake of tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little credence one gives to such reports--mad stories of a\\r\\nscandalous nature--these repeated episodes of excesses, only tolerated\\r\\nin the conspicuous, do color one\\'s expectations. I suppose that, being\\r\\nyoung, I expected to see a man whose face would bear the brand of his\\r\\nerrors as well as the stamp of his genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was not Rodriguez\\'s fate. Whatever the temperamental struggle had\\r\\nbeen, he was \"take him for all in all,\" the least disappointing famous\\r\\nman that my experience had ever shown me. He was more virile than\\r\\nhandsome, and no more aesthetic to look at than he was ascetic. At\\r\\nthat time he was on the sunny side of forty, and not yet at the zenith\\r\\nof his great career. His face was fine, manly, and sympathetic. His\\r\\nbrow was broad, his eyes deep-set and widely spaced, but very heavy\\r\\nlidded. The mouth and chin were, I must own, too delicate and\\r\\nsensitive for the rest of the face. His dark hair, young as he was,\\r\\nhad streaks of grey. In bearing he was so erect, so sufficient, that\\r\\nhe seemed taller than he was. If he had the vanity which so often goes\\r\\nwith his kind of temperament, it was most cleverly concealed. Safe in\\r\\nthe dignified consciousness of his unquestioned gifts, secure in his\\r\\nachievements, he had a winning gentleness, and an engaging manner\\r\\ndifficult to resist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for a singular magnetic light in his eyes, which belied the calm\\r\\nof his bearing, when he chanced to raise the heavy lids full on\\r\\none--they usually drooped a little--but for a sensitive quiver along\\r\\nthe too full lips, as if they still trembled from the caress of\\r\\ngenius--the royal accolade of greatness--he might have looked to me,\\r\\nas he did to many, more the diplomat than the artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be useless for me to analyse his command of his instrument.\\r\\nI could not. It would be superfluous for me to recount his triumphs.\\r\\nThey are too recent to have been forgotten. Both tasks have, moreover,\\r\\nbeen done better than I could do either.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis I can do, however, bear witness to the glowing wings of hope, of\\r\\nlonging, of aspiration which his singing violin lent to hearts\\r\\noppressed by commonplace every-day cares, to the moments of courage,\\r\\nof re-awakened endeavor which he inspired in his fellowmen, to the\\r\\nmarvellous magnetism of his playing which seemed for the moment to\\r\\nrestore to a soul-weary world its illusions, and to strike off the\\r\\nfetters of despondency which bind mortality to earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not alone the musically intelligent who felt this, for his\\r\\nplaying had a universal appeal. Thorough musicians marvelled at and\\r\\nenvied him his mastery of the details of his art, but it seemed to me\\r\\nthat those who knew least of its technique were equally open to his\\r\\ninfluence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t presume to explain this. I merely record it. There were those\\r\\nwho analysed the fact, and explained it on the ground of animal\\r\\nmagnetism. For myself, I only know that, as the magic music which\\r\\nHunold Singref played in the streets of Hamelin, whispered in the ears\\r\\nof little children words of promise, of happiness, of comfort that\\r\\nnone others could hear, so, to the emotional heart, Rodriguez\\'s violin\\r\\nspoke a special message.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who sets the faces of the throng upward, and lights their eyes\\r\\nwith the magic fire of hope, has surely not lived in vain, whatever\\r\\npersonal offerings he may have made on the altar of his genius to keep\\r\\nalive the eternal spark. It cannot be denied that Art has fulfilled\\r\\nsome part of its mission on earth, if, but for one hour, thousands,\\r\\nmarshalled by its music, as the children of Israel by the pillar of\\r\\nflame, have looked above the dull atmosphere where pain and loss and\\r\\nsorrow are, to feel in themselves that divine longing which is\\r\\necstasy, that soaring of the spirit which, in casting off fear and\\r\\nrising above doubt, can cry out in joy, \"Oh, blessed spark of\\r\\nHope--this soul which can so rise above sorrow, so mount above the\\r\\nbody, must be immortal. This which can so cast off care cannot die!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the great acts of life, and all the great arts, are purely\\r\\nemotional. I know that modern cults deny this, and work to see\\r\\neverything gauged by reason. But thus far musicians and painters,\\r\\npreachers and orators all approach their goal by the road to the\\r\\nemotions--if they hope to win the big world. Patriotism,\\r\\nfidelity--love of country, like love of woman--are emotions, and it\\r\\nwould puzzle logicians, I am afraid, to be sure that these emotions,\\r\\nat times sublime, might not be as sensual as some of Rodriguez\\'s\\r\\ncritics found his music.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series of concerts he gave was very exhausting to me, owing to the\\r\\nnovelty of some of his programs, and the constant rehearsals. The\\r\\nfinal concert found me quite worn out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the latter part of the evening I had been too weary to even\\r\\nraise my eyes to the balcony in front of me, where, from my position\\r\\namong the first violins, I could see the fair face of my beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening had been a great triumph, and when it was all over the\\r\\naudience was quite mad with enthusiasm. It was one of Rodriguez\\'s\\r\\ninviolable rules to play a program exactly as announced, and never to\\r\\nadd to it. In the month he had been in town, the public had learned\\r\\nhow impossible it was to tempt him away from his rule. But Americans\\r\\nare persistent!\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain and again he had mounted the steps to the platform, and calmly\\r\\nbowed his thanks, while long drawn cheers surged through the noise of\\r\\nhand-clapping, as strains on the brass buoy up the melody. I lost\\r\\ncount of the number of times he had ascended and descended the little\\r\\nflight of steps which led, behind a screen, from the artist\\'s room to\\r\\nthe stage, when, having turned in my seat to watch him, as he came up\\r\\nand bowed, and walked off again, I saw him, as he stood behind the\\r\\nscreen, gazing directly over our heads, suddenly raise his violin to\\r\\nhis ear and slowly draw the bow across the strings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost before we could realize what had happened, he crossed the\\r\\nstage, stepped to his stand, and drew his bow downward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe applause died sharply on the crest of a crescendo, and left the\\r\\nair trembling. There was a sudden hush. A few sank back in their\\r\\nseats, but most of them remained standing where they were, just as we\\r\\nbehind him were suddenly fixed in our positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have since heard a deal of argument as to the use and power of\\r\\nmusic as the voice of thought. I was not then--and I am not now--of\\r\\nthat school which holds music to be a medium to transmit anything but\\r\\nmusical ideas. So, of the effect of Rodriguez\\'s music on my mind, or\\r\\nthe possibility that, for some occult reason, I was for the moment _en\\r\\nrapport_ with him, as after events forced me to believe, I shall enter\\r\\ninto no discussion. I am merely going to record, to the best of my\\r\\nability, my thoughts, as I remember them. I no more presume to explain\\r\\nwhy they came to me, than I do to analyse my trust in immortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he drew his bow downward, as the first chord filled my ears,\\r\\neverything else faded away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the merest prelude, and then the theme, which appeared,\\r\\ndisappeared and re-appeared again and again to be woven about every\\r\\nemotion, at once developed and dominated me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI seemed at first to hear its melody in the fresh morning air, where\\r\\nit soared upward above the gentle breezes, mingling in harmony with\\r\\nthe matins of the birds and the softly rustling trees. Hopeful as\\r\\nyouth, careless as the wind, it sang in gladness and in trust. Then I\\r\\nheard the same melody throb under the noonday glow of summer. Its tone\\r\\nwas broadened and sweetened, but still brave and pure, when all else\\r\\nin Nature, save its clear voice, seemed sensuous. I saw gardens in a\\r\\nriot of color; felt love at its passionate consummation, ere the light\\r\\nseemed to fade slowly toward the sunset hour. The world was still\\r\\npulsing with color, but the grey of twilight was slowly enwrapping it.\\r\\nThen the simple melody soared above the day\\'s peacefullest hour, firm\\r\\nin promise on the hushed air. In the mystery of night which followed,\\r\\nwhen black clouds snuffed out the torches of heaven, when the silence\\r\\nhad something of terror even for the brave, that same steadfast loving\\r\\nhopeful theme moved on, consoling as trust in immortality. Through\\r\\nyouth to maturity, and on to age, it sang with the same reiterant,\\r\\nsubduing, infallible loyalty--the crystallized melody of all that is\\r\\nspiritual in love, in adoration, in passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it died away into the distance, as if its spirit, barely audible,\\r\\nwere translated to the far off heavenly host, I strained my hearing to\\r\\ncatch that \"last fine sound\" that passed so gently one \"could not be\\r\\nquite sure where it and silence met,\" and for the first and last time\\r\\nin my life I had known all that a violin can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment the hush was wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodriguez stood like a statue. His bow still touched the strings. Yet\\r\\nthere was no sound that one could hear, though his own fine head was\\r\\nstill bent, as though he, too, listened.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gently dropped his bow--he smiled--we all came back to earth\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen such a scene followed as beggars description.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he passed hurriedly out of sight, and no amount of tumult could\\r\\ninduce him to even show himself again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly, reluctantly, the audience dispersed, still murmuring. The\\r\\nmusicians picked up their traps, and wildly or soberly according to\\r\\ntheir temperaments, began to dispute. It was everywhere the same\\r\\ntopic--the unknown work that Rodriguez had so marvellously played.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for me--as he played, I seemed to be in the very heart of the\\r\\nmelody, singing it too, as his violin sang it. As the song soared\\r\\nupward, my heart was filled with longing, with pain, with joy, with\\r\\nregret. As it gradually died into silence a mist seemed to pass from\\r\\nbefore my eyes, and I became suddenly conscious of the sweet face of\\r\\nmy beloved, growing more and more distinct, until, as the last note\\r\\ndied away, I was fully conscious that the music had passed between us,\\r\\nlike a cloud, to obscure my sight utterly, and to recede as slowly,\\r\\nleaving her face before me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew afterward, that, to all appearances, I had been gazing directly\\r\\ninto her face all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough it all I had a vague sense that what he played was not new to\\r\\nme. It seemed like something I had long known and tried to say, but\\r\\ncould not.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a daze, I left the stage. Silently I put my violin in its case,\\r\\npulled on my great coat, and turned up the collar about my face. I was\\r\\nsure I was haggard, and I did not wish her to remark it. I knew that I\\r\\nshould find her waiting in the corridor with her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as I passed out of the artists\\' room, I was surprised to see\\r\\nRodriguez standing there in conversation with her, and her father. He\\r\\nwas, however, just leaving them, and did not see me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew that her father had known him in Vienna, when the now great\\r\\nviolinist was a mere lad, and I had heard that he forgot no one, so\\r\\nthe sight gave me a merely momentary surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I joined her, and we stepped out into the night together, I could\\r\\nnot help wondering if Rodriguez had noticed her sensitive violin face,\\r\\nas I tried to get a look into her eyes. I remembered afterward that,\\r\\nso wrapped was I in my own emotions, and so sure was I of her\\r\\nsympathy, that I neither noted nor asked how the music had affected\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was bitterly cold. We walked briskly, and parted at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I look back, I realize how much an egoist an emotional man can be,\\r\\nand in good faith be unconscious of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after the concert was Saturday--a day on which I rarely saw\\r\\nher, as it was my habit to spend all Sunday with her. I was always\\r\\nsomewhat an epicure in my moral nature. I liked to pet my\\r\\ninclinations, as I have seen good livers whet their appetites, by\\r\\nself-denial.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day I was restless and depressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the piano, with my violin in my hand, it was still that same\\r\\nhaunting melody that bewitched my fingers. Whatever I essayed led me,\\r\\nunconsciously, back to the same theme; and whenever that _motif_ fell\\r\\nfrom my fingers her face appeared before my eyes so distinctly that I\\r\\nwould have to dash my hand across them to wipe away the impression\\r\\nthat it was the real face that was before me. Afterward, when I was\\r\\ncalmer, I knew that this was nothing singular since, whether I had\\r\\never reflected on the fact or not, she was rarely from my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I played that melody over and over again, it puzzled me more and\\r\\nmore. I could find nowhere within my memory anything that even\\r\\nreminded me of it. Yet I was vaguely familiar with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came on I was more restless than ever. By nine o\\'clock I\\r\\nfound it impossible to bear longer with my own company, and I started\\r\\nout. I had no destination. Something impelled me toward the Opera\\r\\nHouse, though I cared little for opera as a rule, that is, opera as we\\r\\nhave it in America--fashionable and Philistine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered the auditorium--the opera was \"Faust\"--just in season to\\r\\nhear the last half of the third act.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sensuous passionate music swelled in the sultry air of the dark\\r\\ngarden at Nuremburg, I listened, moved by it as I always am--when I\\r\\ncannot see the over-dressed, lady-like Marguerite that goes a-starring\\r\\nin America. My eyes wandered restlessly over the audience. Suddenly\\r\\nthere was a rushing, like the surging of waters, in my ears, which\\r\\ndrowned the music, and I saw Rodriguez sitting carelessly in the front\\r\\nof a stage box. His eyes were fixed on me, and I thought there was an\\r\\nexpression of relief in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShocked that the unexpected sight of the man should have such an\\r\\neffect on me, I pulled myself together with an effort. The sound of\\r\\nthe waters receded, the music rushed back, leaving me amazed at a\\r\\ncondition in myself which should have rendered me so susceptible, in\\r\\nsome subconscious way, to the undoubted magnetism of the man whose\\r\\nviolin had so affected me the night before, and so haunted me all day,\\r\\nand in regard to whose composition I had an ill-defined, but\\r\\ninsistent, theory which would intrude into my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain I turned my eyes to the stage. I could not forget his\\r\\npresence. Every few minutes my glance, as if drawn by a magnet, would\\r\\nturn in his direction, and as often as that happened, whether he were\\r\\nleaning back to speak to some one hidden by the curtain, or watching\\r\\nthe house, or listening intently to the music, I never failed to find\\r\\nthat his eyes met mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat through the next act in this condition. Then I could stand it no\\r\\nlonger. I felt that I might end by making myself objectionable, and\\r\\nthat, after all, it was far wiser to be safe at home, than sitting in\\r\\nthe theatre where I occupied myself in staring at but one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made my way slowly up the aisle and into the foyer, and had nearly\\r\\nreached the outer lobby, when I suddenly felt sure that he was near.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked up!\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, there he was, and he was looking me directly in the face again.\\r\\nAn odd smile came into his eyes. He nodded to me as he approached,\\r\\nand, with a quaint shake of the head, said: \"I just made a wager with\\r\\nmyself. I bet that if I encountered you in the lobby, without actually\\r\\nseeking you, and you saw me, I\\'d speak to you--and ask a favor of you.\\r\\nI am going to win that wager.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not seem to expect me to answer him. He simply turned beside\\r\\nme, thrust his arm carelessly through mine, and moved with me toward\\r\\nthe exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us step outside a moment,\" he said. It was easy to understand\\r\\nwhy. The hero of the night before could not hope to pass unnoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a moonlit night. I remember that distinctly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lighted his cigarette, and held his case toward me. I shook my\\r\\nhead. I had no desire to smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked a few steps together in silence before he said: \"I am trying\\r\\nto frame a most unusual request so that it may not seem too fantastic\\r\\nto you. It is more difficult than writing a fugue. The truth is--I\\r\\nhave gotten myself into a bit of a fix--and I want to guard against\\r\\nits turning into something worse than that. I need some man\\'s\\r\\nassistance to extricate myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI probably looked alarmed. Those forebears of mine will intrude when I\\r\\nam taken by surprise. He saw it, and said, quickly: \"It is nothing\\r\\nthat a man, willing to be of service to me, need balk at; nothing, in\\r\\nfact, that a chivalrous man would not be glad to do. You may not\\r\\nthink very well of me afterward, but be sure you will never regret the\\r\\nact. I was in sore need of a friend. There was none at hand--if such\\r\\nas I ever have friends. Suddenly I saw you. I remembered your violin\\r\\nas I heard it behind me last night--an Amati, I fancy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A beautiful instrument. I may some day ask you to let me try it--you\\r\\nand I can never be quite strangers after to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, pounded the side-walk with his stick, impatiently, as if\\r\\nthe long preamble made him as nervous as it did me. Then, looking me\\r\\nin the face, he said rapidly: \"This is it. When I leave the box, after\\r\\nthe next act, do you follow me. Stay by me, no matter what happens.\\r\\nStick to me, even though I ask you to leave me, so long as there is\\r\\nany one with me. Do more--stay by me, until, in your room or mine, you\\r\\nand I sit down together, and--well, I will explain what must, until\\r\\nthen, seem either mad or ridiculous. Is that clear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI assured him that it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Agreed then,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time we were back at the door. The whole thing had not taken\\r\\nfive minutes. We re-entered the theatre, and walked hurriedly through\\r\\nthe lobby to the foyer. As we were about to separate, he laid a hand\\r\\non either of my shoulders, and with a whimsical smile, said: \"I\\'ll\\r\\ndare swear I shall try to give you the slip.\"--The smile died on his\\r\\nlips. It never reached his eyes. \"Don\\'t let me do it. After the next\\r\\nact, then,\" and, with a wave of his hand, he disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought I was ridiculous enough when he had gone, and I realized\\r\\nthat I had promised to follow this man, I did not know where, I did\\r\\nnot know with whom, I did not know why.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was useless for me to go back into the auditorium. I could not\\r\\nlisten to the music. In spite of myself, I kept approaching the\\r\\nentrance opposite the box, and peering through the glass, like a\\r\\ndetective. I knew I was afraid that he would keep his word and try to\\r\\ngive me the slip. I never asked myself what difference it would make\\r\\nto me if he did. I simply took up the strange unexplained task he had\\r\\ngiven me as if to me it were a matter of life or death.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the curtain fell, I had hurried round the house and\\r\\nplaced myself with my back to the door, so that I could not miss him\\r\\nas he passed, and yet had no appearance of watching him. It was well\\r\\nthat I did, for in an instant the door opened. He came out and passed\\r\\nme quickly, followed by a tall slender woman in a straight wrap that\\r\\nfell from her head to the ground, and the domino-like hood which\\r\\ncompletely concealed her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he drew her hand through his arm, he looked back at me, over his\\r\\nshoulder. His eyes met mine. They seemed to say, \"Is it you, old\\r\\nTrue-penny?\" But he merely bent his head courteously and with his lips\\r\\nsaid, \"Come!\" I felt sure that he shrugged his shoulders resignedly,\\r\\nas he saw that I kept my word, and followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the door he found his carriage. He assisted his companion in. Then\\r\\nin the gentlest manner he said in my ear, as he stood aside for me to\\r\\nenter, \"In with you. My honor is saved, but repentance dogs its\\r\\nheels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the lady he said, \"This is the friend whom you were kind enough to\\r\\npermit me to ask for supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nI uncovered my head to salute her, murmuring some vague phrase of\\r\\nthanks, which was, I am sure, inaudible. Then Rodriguez followed, and\\r\\ntook his place beside me on the front seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the door banged I could have sworn that the lady, whose face was\\r\\nconcealed behind the falling lace of her hood, as if by a mask, spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought so, too, for he leaned forward as if to catch the words.\\r\\nEvidently we were mistaken, for he received no response. He murmured\\r\\nan oath against the pavements and the noise, and turned a smiling face\\r\\nto me--and I? Why, I smiled back!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we rattled over the pavings, through the lighted streets, no one\\r\\nspoke. The lady leaned back in her corner. Opposite her Rodriguez\\r\\nhummed \"Salve! dimora\" and I beside him, sat strangely confused and\\r\\ninert, still as if in a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not even noted the direction we were taking, until I found that\\r\\nwe had stopped in front of a French restaurant, one of the few\\r\\nBohemian resorts the town boasted.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodriguez leaped out, assisted the lady, and I followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as we reached the top of the stairs, as I was about to follow\\r\\nthem into one of the small supper rooms, like a flash, as if I were\\r\\nsuddenly waking from a dream into conscious, with exactly the same\\r\\nsensation I have experienced many and many a morning when struggling\\r\\nback to life from sleep, I realized that the slender figure before me\\r\\nwas as familiar as my own hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the door closed behind us, I called her by name--and my voice\\r\\nstartled even myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe threw back the hood of her cape and faced me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodriguez had heard, too. He wheeled quickly toward us, as nearly\\r\\nbroken from his self-control as a man so sure of himself could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the flash of our eyes the color surged up painfully in her pale\\r\\nface. There was much the same expression in our eyes, I\\r\\nfancy,--Rodriguez\\'s and mine--but I felt that it was at his face she\\r\\ngazed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never known how far it is given to woman to penetrate the\\r\\nmysteries of human nature, for she is gifted, it seems to me, with a\\r\\ndissimulation in which she wraps herself, as with an impenetrable veil\\r\\nof outward innocence, and ignorance, from our less acute perception\\r\\nand ruder knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were speeches enough that it would have become a man in my\\r\\nposition to make. I knew them all. But--I said nothing. Some instinct\\r\\nsaved me; some vague fore-knowledge made me feel--I knew not why--that\\r\\nthere was really nothing for me to say at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor fully a minute none of us moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodriguez recovered himself first. I cannot describe the peculiar\\r\\nexpression of his eyes as he slowly turned them from her face to mine.\\r\\nSo bound up was he in himself that I was confident that he did not yet\\r\\nsuspect more than that she and I had met before. What was in her mind\\r\\nI dared not guess.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe composedly crossed to her. He gently unfastened her heavy wrap,\\r\\ncarefully lifted it from her shoulders. He pushed a high backed chair\\r\\ntoward her, and, with a smile, forced her to sit--she did look\\r\\ndangerously white. She sank into it, and wearily leaned her pretty\\r\\nhead back, as if for support, and I noticed that her slender hands, as\\r\\nthey grasped either arm of the chair, trembled, in spite of the grip\\r\\nshe took to steady herself. I felt her whole body vibrate, as a\\r\\nviolin vibrates for a moment after the bow leaves the strings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a strange chance that you two should know each other,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and very well, too, if I may judge from your manner of addressing\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI moved to a place behind her chair, and laid my hand on it. \"This\\r\\nlady is my affianced wife,\" I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not change color. For an instant not a muscle moved. He did not\\r\\nstir a step from his place before the fire, where he stood, with his\\r\\ngaze fixed on her face. For one instant he turned his widely opened\\r\\neyes on me--brief as the glance was, I felt it was critical. Then his\\r\\nlids quivered and drooped completely over his eyes, absolutely veiling\\r\\nthe whole man, and, to my amazement, he laughed aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even as he did so, he spread his hands quickly toward us as if to\\r\\napologize, and ghastly as the comment was, grotesque even, as it all\\r\\nseemed, I think we both understood. He hardly needed to say, \"Pardon\\r\\nme,\" as he quickly recovered his strong hold on himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant he was again standing erect before the fire, with his\\r\\nhands thrust deep into his pockets, and his voice was absolutely calm\\r\\nas he turned toward me and said, with a smile under his half lowered\\r\\nheavy lids, \"I promised you, when I asked you to accompany me, that\\r\\nbefore we slept to-night I would explain my singular request. I hardly\\r\\nthought that I should have to do it, whether I would or not, under\\r\\nthese circumstances. Indeed, it appears that you have the right to\\r\\ndemand of me the explanation I so flippantly offered you an hour ago.\\r\\nI am bound to own that, had I dreamed that you knew this lady--that a\\r\\nrelation so intimate existed between you--I should surely never have\\r\\ndone of my own will this which Fate has presumed to do for me. What\\r\\ncan I say to you two that will help or mend this--to you, my fellow\\r\\nmusician, who were willing to stand my friend in need, without\\r\\nquestion; and to the woman you love, and to whom I owe an eternal\\r\\ndebt--that we may have no doubts of one another in the future? I\\r\\ncannot make excuses well, even if I have the right to. I only hope we\\r\\nare all three so constituted that we may be able to feel that for a\\r\\nlittle we have been outside common causes and common results, and that\\r\\nyou may listen to an explanation which may seem strange, pardon me,\\r\\nand part from me without resentment, being sure that I shall suffer,\\r\\nand yet be glad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe face against the high-backed chair was very pale. She closed her\\r\\neyes. His gaze was on her. He marked the change, I was sure. He thrust\\r\\nhis hands still deeper into his pockets, as if to brace himself, and\\r\\nwent on. \"Last night her pure eyes looked into mine. I had seen her\\r\\nface before me night after night, never dreaming who she was. I had\\r\\nalways played to her, and it had seemed to me at times as if the music\\r\\nI made was in her face. I could see nothing else. I seemed to be\\r\\nlooking through her amber eyes, down, down into her deep beautiful\\r\\nsoul, and my soul reached out toward her, with a sudden knowledge of\\r\\nwhat manhood might have been had all womanhood been pure; of what life\\r\\nmight have been with one who could know no sin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was only her face that I saw, as I stood waiting the end of the\\r\\napplause. I seemed to be gazing between her glorious eyes, as to tell\\r\\nthe truth, I had more than once gazed in my dreams in the past month.\\r\\nI had already written the song that seeing her face had sung in my\\r\\nheart. It was with an irresistible longing, an impulse stronger than\\r\\nmy will, to say to her just what her face had said to me,--though she\\r\\nmight never know it was said to her--that I went back to the stage.\\r\\nAlmost before I realized it, I was there. I felt the vibrant soul of\\r\\nmy violin as I laid my cheek against it, and I saw the same spirit\\r\\ntremble behind the eyes of the fair face above me, as one sees a\\r\\nreflection tremble under the wind rippled water. The first chord\\r\\nthrobbed on the air in response to it. Then I played what she had\\r\\nunconsciously inspired in me. It was in her eyes, where never\\r\\nswerving, immortal loyalty shone, that I read the deathless theme. Out\\r\\nof her nature came the inspiration. To her belongs the honor. I\\r\\nknow--no one better, that as I played last night, I shall never play\\r\\nagain; just as I realize that _what_ I played last night my own nature\\r\\ncould never of itself have created. It was she who spoke, it was not\\r\\nI. Let him who dares, try to explain that miracle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose from her chair and moved toward him, and as she moved, she\\r\\nswayed pitifully.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not stir.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was I who caught her as she stumbled, and I held her close in my\\r\\narms. After a moment, she relaxed a little, and her head drooped\\r\\nwearily on my shoulder. He lowered his lids, and I felt that every\\r\\nnerve in his well controlled body quivered with resentment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe motioned to entreat her to sit down again. She shook her head, and,\\r\\nwhen he went on, again, he for the first time addressed himself\\r\\ndirectly to her. \"It was chance that set you across my path last\\r\\nnight--you and your father. I recognized him at once. I knew your\\r\\nmother well. I can remember the day on which you were born, I was a\\r\\nlad then. Your mother was one of my idols. Why, child, I fiddled for\\r\\nyou in your cradle. At the moment I realized who you were, you were so\\r\\nmuch a part of my music that you only appealed to me through that. But\\r\\nwhen I left you, I carried a consciousness of you with me that was\\r\\nmore tangible. I had held your hand in mine. I feel it there still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went directly to my room, alone. I sat down immediately to\\r\\ntranscribe as much of what I had played as possible while it was\\r\\nfresh in my mind. As I wrote I was alone with you. But as the spirit\\r\\nof the music was imprisoned, I knew that you were becoming more and\\r\\nmore a material presence to me. When I slept, it was to dream of you\\r\\nagain--but, oh, the difference!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should have been grateful to you for the inspiration that you had\\r\\nbeen to me--and I was! But it had served its purpose. They tell me I\\r\\nnever played like that before. I feel I never shall again. But the end\\r\\nof an emotion is never in the spirit with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I started out this afternoon to find you, oblivious of the fact that\\r\\nI should have left town. I had the audacity to tell myself that I\\r\\nshould be a cad if I departed without thanking the sweet daughter of\\r\\nyour mother for her share in making me great. I had the presumption to\\r\\nbelieve in myself. It seemed natural enough to your good father that\\r\\n\\'a whimsical genius,\\' as he called me, should be allowed the caprice\\r\\nof even tardily looking up his boyhood\\'s acquaintance. He received me\\r\\nnobly, was proud that you should see I remembered him--and simply made\\r\\nno secret of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though I knew what you had seemed to me, I little realized that the\\r\\nchild of true, fine musical spirits had a nature strung like my\\r\\nStrad--fine, clear, true, matchless, as well as inspiring. I spent a\\r\\nbeautiful afternoon with you. I cannot better explain than by saying\\r\\nthat to me it was like such a day as I have sometimes had with my\\r\\nviolin. I call them my holy-days, and God knows I try to keep them\\r\\nholy,--though after too many of them follow a St. Michael and the\\r\\nDragon tussle--and I mean no discredit to the Archangel, either.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The honest old father, proud to trust his daughter to me,--in his\\r\\nkind heart he always considered me a most maligned man,--went off to\\r\\nthe play and his Saturday night club. He told me that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were alone together. It was then that I began to think that I\\r\\ncould probably play on her nature as I did on my violin, and then,\\r\\nwith a player\\'s frenzy, to realize that I had been doing it from the\\r\\nfirst; that we had vibrated in harmony like two ends of a chord. Then\\r\\nI saw no more the spirit behind her eyes. I saw only the beautiful\\r\\nface in which the color came and went, the burnished hair so full of\\r\\ngolden lights, on which I longed to lay my hand--the sensitive red\\r\\nlips--and the angel and the demon rose up within me, and looked one\\r\\nanother in the face, and I heard the one fling the truth at the other,\\r\\nwhich even the devil no longer cared to deny--Ah, forgive me!--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his egoism of self-analysis and open confession, I am sure he did\\r\\nnot realize how far he was going, until she buried her face in her\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he stepped across the room and stood before me as she rested her\\r\\nface in her hands against my breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not especially clever--the last struggle against myself. I had\\r\\nnever known such a woman before. I suppose if I had, I should have\\r\\ntortured her to death to strike new chords out of her nature,--and\\r\\nwept at my work! I had not the courage to tear myself abruptly away. I\\r\\nsuggested an hour of the opera--I gave her the public as a\\r\\nprotector--and they sang \\'Faust.\\' It was then that, knowing myself so\\r\\nwell, I looked out into the auditorium and saw you! It was Providence\\r\\nthat put you in my way. I thought it was accident. I am sure I need\\r\\nsay no more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned over her a moment. He gently took her hands from her face.\\r\\nHer eyelids trembled. For one brief moment she opened her eyes to his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have given me one sweet day,\" he murmured. \"Some part of your\\r\\nsoul has called its music out of mine. That offspring of a miraculous\\r\\nsympathy will live immortal when all else of our two lives is\\r\\nforgotten. Remember to-day as a dream--and me as a shadow there--\" he\\r\\nstopped abruptly. I felt her head fall forward. She had swooned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether we looked into the beautiful colorless face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI loved music as I loved light. I was an artist myself. A great\\r\\nmusician--and this man was one--was to me the greatest achievement of\\r\\nArt and Living.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not refuse the hand he held out. I buried mine in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not smile nor mistrust, nor misunderstand the tears in his eyes,\\r\\nnor despise him because I knew they would soon enough be dry. I did\\r\\nnot doubt his sincerity when he said, \"I have never done so bitter a\\r\\nthing as say \\'good-bye\\' to this--though I know but too well such are\\r\\nnot for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bent over her, as if he would take her in his arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was unconscious. I felt tempted to put her there. I knew I loved\\r\\nher as he could never love--yet I pitied him the more for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell her,\" he whispered, \"tell her, when she shall have forgotten\\r\\nthis--as I hope she will--that for this hour at least I loved her;\\r\\nthat losing her I am liable to love her long,--so we shall never meet\\r\\nagain. I shall never cease to be grateful to the Providence that threw\\r\\nyou in my way--after to-night. To-night I could curse it and my\\r\\nconscience with a right good will.\" With an effort he straightened\\r\\nhimself. \"You can afford to forgive me,\" he said, \"for I--I envy you\\r\\nwith all my heart.\"--And he was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard his voice as he spoke to the waiter outside. I listened to his\\r\\nstep as he descended the stairs. He had passed out of our life\\r\\nforever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has long been dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not to blame if the sunshine that danced in music out of the\\r\\neyes of the woman I loved never quite came back again. We were, all\\r\\nthe same, happy together in our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not to blame if it was written in the big book of Fate that it\\r\\nshould be his heart, and not mine, that should read the song she bore\\r\\nin her soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething must be sacrificed for Art. We sacrificed our first\\r\\nillusions--and the Song he read will sing on when even Rodriguez is\\r\\nbut a tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\n\\r\\nEPILOGUE\\r\\n\\r\\nADIEU\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW WE WENT OUT OF THE GARDEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last word had hardly been uttered when the Youngster, who had been\\r\\nfidgeting, leaped to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hark!\" he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cannon,\" he yelled, and rushed out to the big gate, which he tore\\r\\nopen, and dashed into the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no doubt of it. Off to the north we could all hear the dull\\r\\nfar-off booming of artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe followed into the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Youngster was in the middle of the road. As we joined him he bent\\r\\ntoward the ground, as if, Indian-like, he could hear better. \"Hush,\"\\r\\nhe said in a whisper, as we all began to talk. \"Hush! I hear horses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a dead silence, and in it, we could hear the pounding of\\r\\nhorses\\' hoofs in the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better come in out of the rain,\" said the Doctor, and we obeyed. Once\\r\\ninside the gate the Doctor said, \"Well, I reckon it is to-morrow at\\r\\nthe latest for us. The truth of the matter is: I kept something from\\r\\nyou this evening. The village was drummed out last night. As this road\\r\\nis being kept clear, no one passed here, and as we were ready to start\\r\\nat a moment\\'s notice, I made up my mind to have one more evening.\\r\\nHowever, we\\'ve time enough. They can\\'t advance to-night. Too wet. No\\r\\nmoon. Come on into the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe closed and locked the big gate, but before we reached the house,\\r\\nthere was a rush of horsemen in the road--then a halt--the Youngster\\r\\nopened the gate before it was called for. Two mounted men in Khaki\\r\\nrode in, stopped short at the sight of the group, saluted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your house?\" asked one, as he slid from his saddle and leaned against\\r\\nhis horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mine,\" said the Doctor, stepping forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not proposing to stay here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, we are leaving in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Got any conveyances?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two touring cars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good. You don\\'t mind my proposing that you go before daylight, do\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a bit,\" replied the Doctor, \"if it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s for you to decide,\" said the other officer. \"We are going to\\r\\nset up a battery in this garden. Awfully sorry, you know, but it can\\'t\\r\\nbe helped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Youngster, who had remained at the gate, came back, and whispered\\r\\nin my ear, \"They are coming. It\\'s the English still retreating. By\\r\\nJove, it looks as if they would get to Paris!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many are there of you?\" asked the senior officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten,\" replied the Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eleven,\" corrected the Divorcee. \"I shall take Angele and the baby.\"\\r\\nAnd she started on a run for the garage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said the Doctor, looking through the open gate, where the\\r\\nweary soldiers were beginning to straggle by, \"perhaps it will not be\\r\\nnecessary for all of us to go.\" And he went close to the officers, and\\r\\ndrew his papers from his pocket. There was a hurried whispered\\r\\nconversation, in which the Critic and the Journalist joined. When it\\r\\nwas over, the Doctor said, \"I understand,\" and returned to our group.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, good friends,\" he said, \"it really _is_ farewell to the garden!\\r\\nThe Critic and I are going to stay a bit. We are needed. The Youngster\\r\\nwill drive one car, and the Lawyer the other. Get ready to start by\\r\\nthree,--that will be just before daylight--and get into the house, all\\r\\nof you. You are in the way here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody obeyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had less than three hours to get together necessary articles and\\r\\nall the time there was the steady marching of feet in the road, where\\r\\nwhat servants we had were standing with water and such small help as\\r\\ncould be offered a tired army, and bringing in for first aid such of\\r\\nthe exhausted men as could be braced up.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before we were ready, we heard the rumble of the artillery and\\r\\nthe low commands of the officers. In spite of ourselves, we looked out\\r\\nto see the gray things being driven into the gate, and down toward the\\r\\nhillside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" groaned the Divorcee, \"right over the flower beds!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bother it all, don\\'t look out,\" shouted the Youngster from his room.\\r\\n\"That\\'s just like a woman! Be a sport!\" And he dashed down the hall.\\r\\nWe had just time to see that he had \"put that uniform on.\" He was\\r\\ngoing into the big game, and he was dressed for the part. In a certain\\r\\nsense, all the men were, when we at last, bags in hand, gathered in\\r\\nthe dining room, so we were not surprised to find the Nurse in her\\r\\nhospital rig, with a white cap covering her hair, and the red cross on\\r\\nher arm. We knew at once that she was remaining behind with the Doctor\\r\\nand the Critic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cars were at the door. Angele, with her baby in her arms, was\\r\\nsitting in one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on,\" said the Doctor, \"the quicker you are out of this the\\r\\nbetter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, almost without a word, like soldiers under orders, we were packed\\r\\ninto the two cars. The Youngster, the Lawyer, and the two officers\\r\\nstood together with their heads bent over a map.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better take a side road,\" said the officer, \"until you get near to\\r\\nMeaux, then take the route de Senlis. It will lead you right over the\\r\\nhill into the Meaux, then you will find the _route nationale_ free.\\r\\nCross the Marne there, and on into Paris by the forest of Vincennes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the Lawyer lead,\" said the Doctor, \"and be prudent, Youngster.\\r\\nYou know where a letter will reach me. See that the girls get off\\r\\nsafely!\" He shook hands all round. The cars shot out of the gate,\\r\\ntooted for a passage through the straggling line of tired men in\\r\\nKhaki, took the first turn to get out of the way, and shot down the\\r\\nhill to the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the Youngster, who was driving our car, with the\\r\\nViolinist beside him, \"I think we behaved fine, and, by Jove, how I\\r\\nhate to go just now! But I have to join day after to-morrow, and I\\r\\nsuppose it will be a long time before I see anything as exciting as\\r\\nthis. Bother it. Well, you were amazed at the calmness only\\r\\nyesterday!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one replied. We were all busy with our own thoughts, and with\\r\\n\"playing the game.\" In silence we crossed the first bridge. Day was\\r\\njust breaking as we mounted the hill on the other side. Suddenly the\\r\\nYoungster put on the brake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" he said to the Violinist, \"take the wheel a moment. I must\\r\\nlook back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he spoke there was a tremendous explosion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bomb,\" he cried, as he got out his glass, and, standing on the\\r\\nrunning board, looked back. \"They\\'ve got it,\" he yelled. \"Look!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all piled out of the car, and ran to the edge of the hill. From\\r\\nthere we could look back and just see the dear old house standing on\\r\\nthe opposite height in its walled garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another explosion, and a puff of smoke seemed to rise right\\r\\nout of the middle of the garden, where the old tree stood, under which\\r\\nwe had dined so many evenings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few minutes we stood in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the gentle voice of the Violinist that called us back. \"Better\\r\\nget on,\" he said. \"We can do nothing now but obey orders,\" and quietly\\r\\nwe crawled back and the car started on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not speak again until we ran up to the gates of Paris, and\\r\\nstopped to have our papers examined for the last time. Then I said,\\r\\nwith a laugh: \"And only think! I did not tell my story at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said the Youngster. \"What a shame. Never mind, dear, you\\r\\ncan tell the whole story!\"--And I have.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Told in a French Garden, by Mildred Aldrich\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOLD IN A FRENCH GARDEN ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 18004.txt or 18004.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/0/0/18004/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Audrey Longhurst, Sankar Viswanathan, and the\\r\\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\\r\\n\\r\\n')]"
